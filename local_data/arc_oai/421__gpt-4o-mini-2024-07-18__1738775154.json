  "query": "Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will\n\nChoices:\nA: absorb the forces.\nB: come to an immediate stop.\nC: continue to move in the same direction.\nD: move in the same direction as the larger force.",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a scenario where two unequal forces are acting in opposite directions on a moving object.",
    "According to Newton's second law, the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force, which is the difference between the two forces acting on it.",
    "Since the forces are unequal, the net force will be equal to the larger force minus the smaller force, and this net force will determine the object's motion.",
    "If the larger force is in the same direction as the object's initial movement, the object will continue to move in that direction but at a reduced speed if the smaller force opposes it.",
    "If the larger force is acting opposite to the direction of the object's movement, the object will slow down, and if it is strong enough, it may come to a stop.",
    "However, since the question is structured to ask about the general behavior of the object under the influence of two unequal forces, the most applicable answer is that the object will move in the direction of the larger force, as it determines the overall motion."
