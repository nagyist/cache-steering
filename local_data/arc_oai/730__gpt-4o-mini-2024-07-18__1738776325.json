  "steps": [
    "Firstly, I need to identify which actions in the choices are instinctive behaviors and which are learned behaviors. Instinctive behaviors are innate and typically performed without prior experience, while learned behaviors are acquired through experience or observation.",
    "Looking at option A, a bird building a nest is generally considered an instinctive behavior, as many birds are born with the innate ability to construct nests without needing to learn from others.",
    "For option B, a spider spinning a web is also an instinctive behavior. Spiders are born with the ability to spin webs, which is crucial for their survival, and do not need to learn this from others.",
    "Next, examining option C, a lion cub practicing its hunting skills suggests an element of learning. While hunting is an instinctual behavior, the cubs learn techniques and strategies through observation and practice, usually from their mothers or other members of the pride.",
    "Finally, in option D, an earthworm moving away from bright light is a reflexive instinctual behavior. Earthworms are naturally inclined to avoid light as a survival mechanism, which does not involve learning.",
    "Since option C is the only one that illustrates a behavior that requires observation and practice, it is the best choice to represent a learned behavior."
