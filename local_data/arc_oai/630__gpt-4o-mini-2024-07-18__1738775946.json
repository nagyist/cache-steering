  "query": "Question: Storms transport water in the form of rain. The energy that starts this process comes from the\n\nChoices:\nA: Sun.\nB: oceans.\nC: Earth.\nD: clouds.",
  "steps": [
    "The process of storms and rain is primarily driven by energy. To determine the source of this energy, we need to consider where weather phenomena originate from.",
    "The sun plays a crucial role in the water cycle by providing energy that evaporates water from oceans, rivers, and lakes, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation.",
    "While oceans store a significant amount of water and can affect weather patterns, the initial energy that drives the process of evaporation and, consequently, storms comes from the sun.",
    "Earth's energy is not a direct factor in the creation of storms, nor do clouds provide energy to initiate storms; they are a result of the process."
