  "query": "Question: Which simple machine increases the distance over which a load travels and reduces the needed force?\n\nChoices:\nA: wheel and axle\nB: wedge\nC: pulley\nD: inclined plane",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the function of each type of simple machine listed in the choices.",
    "A wheel and axle helps in reducing the friction and allowing easier movement of loads but doesn\u2019t specifically increase distance over which a load travels.",
    "A wedge is used to split things apart or hold objects together, rather than increasing distance over which a load travels.",
    "A pulley changes the direction of force but doesn't necessarily increase the distance traveled by the load.",
    "An inclined plane allows a load to be raised by extending the distance over which it is lifted, thus reducing the needed force."
