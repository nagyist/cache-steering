  "query": "Question: What is the most common element found in the compounds that make up ocean water?\n\nChoices:\nA: nitrogen\nB: oxygen\nC: carbon\nD: silicon",
  "steps": [
    "Ocean water is primarily composed of salt, which is sodium chloride (NaCl), and other dissolved substances. The most abundant compound in ocean water is water itself, which is H2O.",
    "In the chemical formula for water (H2O), we can see that it contains oxygen. Each water molecule consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.",
    "Apart from water, ocean water contains various dissolved gases and minerals. Among these, oxygen is also commonly found in dissolved forms (like O2) and is essential for marine life.",
    "The options provided include nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and silicon. Among these, oxygen is the most prevalent element in ocean water since it is a major component of water and is highly soluble in it."
