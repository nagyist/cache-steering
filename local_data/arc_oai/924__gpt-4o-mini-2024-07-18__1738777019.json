  "query": "Question: Researchers work in teams to make cars more fuel efficient. Which of these statements describes the main advantage of working in teams rather than working individually?\n\nChoices:\nA: The research is more likely to be published.\nB: The research costs less to perform.\nC: The researchers can share their ideas.\nD: The researchers have more time to complete work.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the main advantage of working in teams, we need to analyze each statement and its relevance to teamwork in research.",
    "Statement A suggests that being in a team leads to a higher likelihood of publication, but this is not inherently tied to the advantage of team collaboration itself.",
    "Statement B claims that research costs less when performed in teams; however, team collaboration does not necessarily mean lower costs and often can lead to increased expenses due to more personnel involved.",
    "Statement C highlights that researchers can share their ideas, which is a core benefit of teamwork, fostering collaboration and innovation through diverse perspectives.",
    "Statement D suggests that researchers have more time to complete work, which is not a guaranteed advantage of working in teams, as teams may face coordination challenges.",
    "The most relevant and direct advantage of teamwork in research, especially in terms of fostering new ideas and improving outcomes, is found in Statement C."
