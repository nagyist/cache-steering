  "query": "Question: Which is the best explanation why the remains of a small reptile living millions of years ago have been found only in Brazil and South Africa?\n\nChoices:\nA: subduction\nB: plate tectonics\nC: mass extinction\nD: converging boundaries",
  "steps": [
    "To understand why the remains of a small reptile are found only in Brazil and South Africa, we should consider the geological context. Millions of years ago, Brazil and South Africa were part of the same landmass known as Gondwana.",
    "After Gondwana began to break apart, Brazil and South Africa drifted to their current positions. The fossil evidence can be explained by the fact that these lands were once connected, allowing the small reptile to inhabit both areas.",
    "While subduction and converging boundaries are geological processes that can influence land formation and tectonic activity, they do not specifically explain why the same species' remains are found in these two distinct locations.",
    "Mass extinction events could possibly lead to widespread fossilization in certain regions, but they do not account for why a specific reptile would be found in only these two locations.",
    "Plate tectonics is the theory that explains the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. It encompasses the formation and separation of landmasses like Gondwana, thus providing the most comprehensive explanation for the presence of the reptile's remains in Brazil and South Africa."
