  "query": "Question: To conserve the supply of nonrenewable resources, it is best to recycle\n\nChoices:\nA: newspapers.\nB: phonebooks.\nC: paper towels.\nD: soda cans.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nonrenewable resources involved in the production of each item. Newspapers and phonebooks primarily use renewable resources (wood), while paper towels may also use similar resources. Soda cans, on the other hand, are made from aluminum, which is a nonrenewable resource.",
    "Next, assess the recycling potential of each option. Recycling soda cans allows for the recovery of aluminum, reducing the need for new extraction, which is critical for nonrenewable resources.",
    "Compare the overall impact of recycling each option. While recycling newspapers and phonebooks helps save trees, they don't directly conserve nonrenewable resources. Paper towels potentially save trees but are typically less recyclable due to contamination. In contrast, recycling soda cans directly reduces the use of nonrenewable aluminum."
