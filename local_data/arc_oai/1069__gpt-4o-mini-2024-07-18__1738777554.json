  "query": "Question: A handheld sewing machine uses a battery to make a needle move. The needle goes up and down quickly. Which energy change is taking place?\n\nChoices:\nA: Motion changes to chemical energy.\nB: Stored energy changes to motion.\nC: Electricity changes to stored energy.\nD: Heat changes to electricity.",
  "steps": [
    "The sewing machine operates using a battery, which provides electrical energy to power the device.",
    "The electrical energy from the battery is used to move the needle up and down, which is a form of motion.",
    "The conversion happening here is from the electrical energy stored in the battery to kinetic energy (motion) of the needle."
  ],
  "solution": "B"
