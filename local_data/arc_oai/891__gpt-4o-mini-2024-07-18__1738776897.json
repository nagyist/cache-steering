  "query": "Question: Which is a problem with using wind turbines to produce energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wind turbines are efficient only in certain areas.\nB: Wind turbines occupy a small area of land.\nC: Wind turbines produce a large amount of energy.\nD: Wind turbines create a large amount of pollution.",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to evaluate the options provided to identify which one describes a problem related to wind turbines.",
    "Option A states that wind turbines are efficient only in certain areas. This implies a geographical limitation, which is a genuine concern in their implementation.",
    "Option B claims that wind turbines occupy a small area of land. This is generally not considered a problem, as occupying less land can be seen as an advantage.",
    "Option C states that wind turbines produce a large amount of energy. While this is true and generally seen as a benefit, it is not a problem.",
    "Option D mentions that wind turbines create a large amount of pollution. However, wind energy is known for being clean and renewable, so this is not accurate.",
    "The only choice that reflects a real limitation or problem with wind turbines is option A, as it highlights their efficiency being affected by geographic factors."
