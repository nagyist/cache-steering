  "query": "Question: Jennifer and Mark prepared a layer cake using oil and water. After the cake baked in the oven, they added frosting. Which property could be measured with a balance?\n\nChoices:\nA: the temperature of the oven\nB: the mass of the frosting\nC: the height of the layers\nD: the volume of the oil",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which property can be measured with a balance, which typically measures mass.",
    "Option A mentions measuring the temperature of the oven, which cannot be done with a balance.",
    "Option B refers to the mass of the frosting, which can be measured using a balance, as mass is a primary measurement that balances provide.",
    "Option C suggests measuring the height of the layers, which cannot be done with a balance, since height is a length measurement.",
    "Option D involves measuring the volume of the oil, which also cannot be accomplished with a balance, as volume typically requires a graduated cylinder or similar measuring device."
