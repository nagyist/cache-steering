  "query": "Question: A scientist conducts an experiment on the growth rate of a specific species of plant. Which of these is needed for the data to be relied upon by other scientists?\n\nChoices:\nA: The investigation must use many variables.\nB: Equipment used in the investigation must be new.\nC: Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately.\nD: The investigation needs to be performed by well-known scientists.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine the dependability of the data in the experiment, it is important to consider what makes research results valid and reliable. Reliable data must be based on accurate recordings and consistent methodologies.",
    "The choice that emphasizes the necessity of accurately recording results points towards the foundational requirement for other scientists to trust the findings. Accurate data is essential for replicability and verification.",
    "While using many variables (choice A) can sometimes complicate an investigation, it could also mean introducing confounding factors, which doesn't necessarily enhance reliability. New equipment (choice B) isn't essential; what matters is the accuracy of the results collected. The reputation of the scientists (choice D) doesn't guarantee the quality of the investigation or its outcomes."
