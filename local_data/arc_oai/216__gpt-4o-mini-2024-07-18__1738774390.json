  "steps": [
    "Kinetic energy refers to the energy of motion, which means that as the kinetic energy of water molecules increases, they move more rapidly.",
    "In the context of water phases, increased kinetic energy typically leads to a phase transition from a liquid to a gas because the molecules have enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces.",
    "Conversely, if kinetic energy decreases, water molecules may move closer together and transition from gas to liquid, or from liquid to solid.",
    "Since the question specifies an increase in kinetic energy, we should focus on what occurs as water molecules gain energy.",
    "When water molecules gain kinetic energy, they are more likely to transition from a liquid state to a gaseous state, which corresponds to water vapor formation."
