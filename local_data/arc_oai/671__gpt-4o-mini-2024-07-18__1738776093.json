  "query": "Question: Which type of activity would most likely be included on a weather map?\n\nChoices:\nA: satellite\nB: seismic\nC: volcanic\nD: hurricane",
  "steps": [
    "I need to identify which option relates specifically to weather phenomena that could be displayed on a weather map.",
    "A weather map typically shows precipitation, temperature, pressure systems, and severe weather events.",
    "Satellite imagery can be used to observe weather systems, but it is not directly an activity that would be mapped.",
    "Seismic activities involve earthquakes and are not related to weather or meteorological conditions.",
    "Volcanic activities can affect weather but are not weather phenomena themselves and would not typically be shown on a standard weather map.",
    "Hurricanes are significant weather events that are closely monitored and displayed on weather maps, as they can have a major impact on weather conditions."
