  "query": "Question: Which type of force requires contact between two objects for one to push or pull the other?\n\nChoices:\nA: frictional forces slowing down a rolling soccer ball\nB: the magnetic force pulling paper clips to a powerful electromagnet\nC: the magnetic force pushing two magnets apart\nD: the force of gravity acting on raindrops that fall to Earth",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which type of force requires contact between two objects, we need to identify the nature of each force mentioned in the options.",
    "Option A refers to frictional forces, which are indeed contact forces as they occur between surfaces in contact and involve the interaction that slows down a moving object.",
    "Option B describes the magnetic force, which is a non-contact force since it can exert attraction or repulsion without physical contact.",
    "Option C also describes the magnetic force, which is similar to option B in that it can act without contact between the magnets.",
    "Option D refers to the gravitational force, which acts over a distance and does not require contact between Earth and the raindrops.",
    "Now we can conclude that only option A involves a force that requires contact between two objects, namely the frictional forces acting on the soccer ball."
