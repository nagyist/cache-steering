  "query": "Question: A carpenter covered a piece of wood with a thin sheet of paper. He struck the covered piece of wood with a hammer. The impact left a small hole in the paper that smelled of smoke. Which kind of energy transfer did this event most likely demonstrate?\n\nChoices:\nA: chemical to thermal\nB: mechanical to thermal\nC: mechanical to chemical\nD: chemical to mechanical",
  "steps": [
    "The carpenter strikes the covered piece of wood with a hammer, which involves the application of force and motion.",
    "The impact of the hammer causes damage to the thin sheet of paper, resulting in a small hole.",
    "The smell of smoke indicates a change that likely involves heat produced from the impact, suggesting an increase in temperature due to the mechanical action.",
    "The heat produced from the mechanical impact can lead to combustion or alteration in the properties of the paper, hence causing a chemical reaction (e.g., burning) resulting in smoke.",
    "Thus, the energy transfer primarily reflects the conversion of mechanical energy (from the hammer strike) to thermal energy (due to heat causing smoke and possibly burning)."
