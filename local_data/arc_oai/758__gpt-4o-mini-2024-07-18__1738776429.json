  "query": "Question: Due to the increasing average temperature of the atmosphere, polar ice sheets melt at a greater rate than they form. Which of these will be an effect of the continued melting of polar ice?\n\nChoices:\nA: A major reservoir of fresh water will decrease.\nB: Plant life will increase due to higher sea levels.\nC: Water runoff will cause an increase in ocean salinity.\nD: Ocean temperature will decrease with the addition of cold water.",
  "steps": [
    "The melting of polar ice sheets primarily contributes freshwater to the oceans, meaning that a major reservoir of fresh water (the polar ice) will decrease as it melts and flows into the sea.",
    "With higher sea levels, plant life does not necessarily increase; in fact, it can lead to flooding of coastal habitats which may hinder plant growth.",
    "The addition of freshwater from melting ice could potentially decrease ocean salinity rather than increase it, especially in regions close to melting ice.",
    "Cold water entering the ocean from melting polar ice is unlikely to decrease ocean temperatures significantly, as the surrounding water is generally warmer, and the mixing processes will lead to a more homogenized ocean temperature."
