  "query": "Question: Which statement describes a harmful effect of clearing rainforests for farmland?\n\nChoices:\nA: makes more land available for local farmers\nB: removes valuable habitat for local species\nC: increases local groundwater levels\nD: provides income for local residents",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for a harmful effect of clearing rainforests for farmland. I need to analyze each option for its implications regarding harm.",
    "Option A suggests that clearing rainforests makes more land available for local farmers. This is potentially positive and does not indicate harm.",
    "Option B states that clearing rainforests removes valuable habitat for local species. Loss of habitat is a significant ecological harm, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem health.",
    "Option C implies that clearing rainforests increases local groundwater levels. This is typically not true, as deforestation can lead to decreased groundwater recharge, indicating it\u2019s unrelated to harm in the context of this question.",
    "Option D mentions that clearing rainforests provides income for local residents. While this may have short-term economic benefits, it does not describe an intrinsic harmful effect of the action itself.",
    "After evaluating all the options, option B clearly identifies a harmful ecological effect due to habitat loss."
