  "query": "Question: Currently, Antarctica is the coldest and driest place on Earth. Paleontologists have found dinosaur fossils in rock layers below the ice. Based on this evidence, which is a reasonable conclusion about the climate of Antarctica in the past?\n\nChoices:\nA: Antarctica has always had the same climate as at present.\nB: At some time in the past, Antarctica was a hot, dry desert.\nC: At some time in the past, Antarctica was much warmer and wetter.\nD: At some time in the past, Antarctica was colder and wetter than it is now.",
  "steps": [
    "The existence of dinosaur fossils in Antarctica indicates that there were once living organisms in that region, which suggests a more hospitable climate than the current extreme cold and dryness.",
    "Dinosaurs are typically associated with warmer climates, which implies that Antarctica must have been relatively warmer during the time dinosaurs lived there.",
    "Additionally, the presence of fossilized remains implies the availability of water and vegetation, which were necessary to support life, indicating that Antarctica was likely wetter in the past than it is now.",
    "Considering these factors, the most reasonable conclusion is that Antarctica once had a climate that was significantly warmer and wetter than the present day."
