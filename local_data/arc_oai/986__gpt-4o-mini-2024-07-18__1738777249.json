  "query": "Question: Biologists are studying the white-tailed deer population in Ohio. Which question could the biologists most likely answer?\n\nChoices:\nA: How fast does this deer population grow?\nB: What percentage of people enjoy watching deer?\nC: Does this deer population like warmer states?\nD: Should people raise deer as pets?",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what biologists study regarding animal populations. They typically focus on population dynamics, behaviors, and demographics of the species in their natural habitat.",
    "Next, evaluate each option. Option A asks about the growth rate of the deer population, which falls under population dynamics and is a question biologists can answer with their studies.",
    "Option B is not related to the deer population itself but rather to human opinions, which biologists would not typically assess directly.",
    "Option C questions the preferences of the deer population regarding climate, which is more about habits rather than a direct population study.",
    "Option D relates to the domestication of deer, which is outside the typical focus of biologists studying wild populations."
