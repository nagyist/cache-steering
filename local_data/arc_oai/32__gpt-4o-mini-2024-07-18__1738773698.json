  "query": "Question: Which of these human activities does not contribute to the extinction of species?\n\nChoices:\nA: hunting\nB: habitat destruction\nC: restoration ecology\nD: introduced nonnative species",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to analyze the options provided to understand their contributions to species extinction.",
    "Option A, hunting, directly reduces populations of species, which can lead to extinction if done unsustainably.",
    "Option B, habitat destruction, removes and degrades the environments where species live, making it a significant factor in species extinction.",
    "Option C, restoration ecology, aims to restore degraded ecosystems and helps in the recovery of species, which supports biodiversity rather than harming it.",
    "Option D, introduced nonnative species, often compete with or prey on native species, leading to declines or extinctions of local species.",
    "Since we are looking for the activity that does not contribute to extinction, option C, restoration ecology, is the only one that actively works against extinction processes."
