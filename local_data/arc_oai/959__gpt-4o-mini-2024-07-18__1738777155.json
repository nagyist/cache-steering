  "query": "Question: What do scientists mean when they refer to a population?\n\nChoices:\nA: all the organisms in an ecosystem\nB: all the species that share similar anatomical features\nC: all the animals that acquire resources through similar methods\nD: all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"population\" in ecological and biological contexts generally pertains to a specific group of organisms rather than the broader ecosystem or all species.",
    "Choice A refers to \"all the organisms in an ecosystem,\" which describes a broader ecological concept, not limited to a specific species.",
    "Choice B talks about \"all the species that share similar anatomical features,\" which again refers to multiple species and not a single population.",
    "Choice C describes \"all the animals that acquire resources through similar methods,\" focusing on a functional aspect but not clearly defining a population.",
    "Choice D correctly states \"all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem,\" which aligns with the biological definition of a population as it focuses on a single species and emphasizes interbreeding."

  "solution": "D"
