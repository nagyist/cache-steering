  "query": "Question: A student accidentally drops a test tube that breaks when it hits the floor. Which method is the best way to retrieve the broken glass?\n\nChoices:\nA: pick up the pieces with a paper towel\nB: use a chemical spill kit\nC: use a dustpan and broom\nD: pick up the pieces by hand",
  "steps": [
    "The first consideration is safety. Picking up broken glass with your hands can lead to cuts and injuries.",
    "Using a paper towel to pick up the glass is not effective because the glass shards could easily tear through the paper and still pose a risk of injury.",
    "A dustpan and broom provides a safer, more effective way to collect small glass shards without risking injury to your hands, though care must still be taken to sweep carefully.",
    "A chemical spill kit is not relevant here as the test tube may contain a substance, but if no hazardous chemicals are present, its usage is unnecessary.",
    "Considering effectiveness and safety, using a dustpan and broom is the most sensible approach."
