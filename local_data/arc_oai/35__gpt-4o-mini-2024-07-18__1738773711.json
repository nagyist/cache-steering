  "query": "Question: Which celestial object listed below has the greatest density?\n\nChoices:\nA: a planet\nB: a comet\nC: a nebula\nD: a neutron star",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which celestial object has the greatest density, I need to understand the properties of each option provided.",
    "A planet can vary widely in density but generally has a solid or liquid structure with a density ranging from 1 to 10 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\u00b3).",
    "A comet, largely made of ice and dust, typically has a much lower density, often around 0.5 g/cm\u00b3 to 1 g/cm\u00b3.",
    "A nebula consists mostly of gas and dust in space, which has an extremely low density, usually much less than 1 g/cm\u00b3.",
    "A neutron star is the remnant of a supernova explosion and is incredibly dense, with densities around 10^14 g/cm\u00b3, owing to the collapse of atomic structures into neutrons.",
    "Comparing these densities, the neutron star has the highest density by far, while the other options are significantly less dense."
