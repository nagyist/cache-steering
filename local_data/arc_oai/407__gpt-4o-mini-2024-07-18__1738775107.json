  "steps": [
    "First, determine the elements present in the formula unit of magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)\u2082. It consists of magnesium (Mg), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H).",
    "Count the number of each type of atom in the formula. There is 1 magnesium atom, 2 oxygen atoms (from the 2 OH groups), and 2 hydrogen atoms (also from the 2 OH groups).",
    "Add the total number of atoms: 1 (Mg) + 2 (O) + 2 (H) = 5 atoms."
