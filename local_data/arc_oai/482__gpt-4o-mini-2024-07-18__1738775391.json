  "query": "Question: Which statement best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid?\n\nChoices:\nA: The molecules move faster and occupy more space.\nB: The molecules move slower and occupy more space.\nC: The molecules move faster and occupy less space.\nD: The molecules move slower and occupy less space.",
  "steps": [
    "When water changes state from steam (gas) to liquid, the water molecules transition from a high-energy state to a lower energy state.",
    "In the gaseous state (steam), water molecules move rapidly and are spaced far apart, which allows them to occupy more space.",
    "As the steam cools and condenses into liquid, the water molecules lose energy, which causes them to move slower.",
    "The slower movement of the water molecules also means they come closer together, resulting in a decrease in the volume occupied, thus occupying less space."

  "solution": "D"
