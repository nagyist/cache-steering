  "query": "Question: A botanist developed a new fertilizer that was tested on different types of plants under different conditions. The results indicated that the fertilizer increased plant growth. Which would be the best way to validate the results?\n\nChoices:\nA: have another lab replicate the tests\nB: look over the results several times\nC: develop a new hypothesis to test\nD: change the procedure",
  "steps": [
    "The results of the fertilization test show that the fertilizer increased plant growth; however, to ensure the findings are valid and not due to chance or specific conditions in the original experiment, replication is crucial.",
    "Replicating the tests in another lab provides an independent verification of the results. Different conditions and potential biases can be accounted for in a new setting, reinforcing the credibility of the findings.",
    "While looking over the results and developing new hypotheses could provide additional insights, they do not serve as direct validation of the original findings. Changing the procedure may lead to different results that cannot confirm the original hypothesis."
