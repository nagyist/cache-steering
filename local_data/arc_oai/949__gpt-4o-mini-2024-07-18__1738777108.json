  "query": "Question: Below is an advertisement found in a local newspaper. As shiny as diamonds at a fraction of the price! Buy \"Simu-Gems\" at Cost-Rite Jewelers. This advertisement suggests that Cost-Rite Jewelers' supplier\n\nChoices:\nA: found a less expensive way to mine and process diamonds.\nB: manufactured artificial stones that resemble diamonds.\nC: reduced the price of diamonds in order to sell more.\nD: started providing small diamonds instead of large ones.",
  "steps": [
    "The advertisement states that \"Simu-Gems\" are as shiny as diamonds but are sold at a fraction of the price, which implies that they are not actual diamonds but something that looks like diamonds.",
    "Considering the choices provided, option A suggests that there is a less expensive method to mine and process genuine diamonds, which does not align with the implication of the advertisement that indicates a substitute for diamonds.",
    "Option C suggests that the price of diamonds was reduced, but the advertisement is specifically promoting \"Simu-Gems\" as an alternative, not stating anything about actual diamond prices.",
    "Option D suggests that small diamonds are being sold instead of large ones, which also does not match the advertisement's message that emphasizes a substitute product rather than a smaller quantity or size of diamonds.",
    "Option B, however, indicates that the supplier manufactured artificial stones that resemble diamonds, which perfectly aligns with the advertisement's assertion of \"Simu-Gems\" being similar to diamonds yet cheaper."
