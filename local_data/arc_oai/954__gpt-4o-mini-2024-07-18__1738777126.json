  "query": "Question: The Sahara Desert in Africa has high daytime temperatures but low nighttime temperatures. Which factor is mainly responsible for low nighttime temperatures in the Sahara Desert?\n\nChoices:\nA: coarse soil\nB: low latitude\nC: lack of clouds\nD: high altitude",
  "steps": [
    "The Sahara Desert experiences high daytime temperatures due to intense solar radiation, but nighttime temperatures drop significantly. This suggests that heat retention during the night is minimal.",
    "One factor that affects nighttime temperatures is cloud cover. Clouds can trap heat during the night, preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. The Sahara is known for having clear skies at night, leading to rapid heat loss.",
    "By examining the choices: coarse soil and high altitude do not primarily influence nighttime heat retention. Low latitude explains daytime heating but not the nighttime cooling effect. The lack of clouds is a critical factor that allows heat to escape at night."
