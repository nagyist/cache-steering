  "query": "Question: Four solid balls, each with a different mass, are moving at the same speed. Which ball would require the most force to stop its motion?\n\nChoices:\nA: ball with a mass of 5 kg\nB: ball with a mass of 10 kg\nC: ball with a mass of 15 kg\nD: ball with a mass of 20 kg",
  "steps": [
    "To stop a moving object, the force required is directly related to its mass according to Newton's second law, which states that Force = Mass \u00d7 Acceleration. Since all the balls are moving at the same speed, the acceleration needed to stop them is the same for each.",
    "Given that the acceleration is the same, the force required to stop each ball will be proportional to their respective masses.",
    "From the choices, the ball with the highest mass will require the most force to stop.",
    "The ball with the largest mass among the given options is the ball with a mass of 20 kg (Choice D)."
