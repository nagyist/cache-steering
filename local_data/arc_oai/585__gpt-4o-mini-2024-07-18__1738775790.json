  "query": "Question: How does a parachute sufficiently increase air resistance to allow the parachutist to land safely?\n\nChoices:\nA: by decreasing the force of gravity acting on the parachutist\nB: by decreasing the total mass of the parachutist\nC: by increasing the surrounding air pressure around the parachute\nD: by increasing the total surface area of the parachute",
  "steps": [
    "The function of a parachute is primarily to slow down the descent of a parachutist by creating drag against gravity.",
    "Air resistance, or drag, is increased when the surface area of an object increases; this is a key principle in physics.",
    "A parachute has a large surface area when deployed, which effectively increases air resistance as it falls through the air.",
    "Choices A, B, and C focus on gravity and mass, which do not directly contribute to the increase of air resistance in the context of parachuting.",
    "Therefore, the correct choice must reflect the mechanism of increasing air resistance, which is achieved by the parachute\u2019s expanded surface area."
