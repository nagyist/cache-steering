  "query": "Question: Which unit is used to record distances between stars?\n\nChoices:\nA: miles\nB: kilometers\nC: light years\nD: astronomical units",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the relative distances of stars compared to more familiar measures like miles and kilometers. Distances in space are vastly greater than distances on Earth.",
    "Next, review the options: miles and kilometers are too small for astronomical distances, while light years and astronomical units are both measures used specifically in astronomy.",
    "Then, analyze the terms. A light year is defined as the distance that light travels in one year, and it is commonly used for measuring distances between stars. An astronomical unit primarily measures distances within our solar system, such as the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.",
    "Based on the definitions and common usage in astronomy, the light year is specifically tailored for stellar distances, making it the most appropriate choice."
