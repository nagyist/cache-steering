  "query": "Question: The gametes of human males and females have the same number of chromosomes. Which best describes what happens to the chromosomes when typical male and female gametes combine to produce offspring?\n\nChoices:\nA: The chromosomes change shape.\nB: The number of chromosomes doubles.\nC: The chromosomes become larger in size.\nD: The number of chromosomes reduces by half.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the number of chromosomes in human gametes. Humans have 46 chromosomes in somatic (body) cells, but gametes (sperm and eggs) only have 23 chromosomes each due to meiosis.",
    "Next, when male and female gametes combine during fertilization, the sperm (23 chromosomes) and the egg (23 chromosomes) come together to form a zygote.",
    "In the zygote, the number of chromosomes is the sum of the chromosomes from both gametes, leading to a total of 46 chromosomes (23 from the male and 23 from the female).",
    "Thus, the number of chromosomes does not reduce or double when the gametes combine; it returns to the normal diploid state of 46 chromosomes."
