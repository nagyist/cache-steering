  "query": "Question: One 7.0 kg bowling ball is lifted to a storage shelf 1.0 m above the floor. A second 7.0 kg ball is lifted to a storage shelf 2.0 m above the floor. Which of the following best explains why the measured force of gravity on each ball is nearly identical?\n\nChoices:\nA: The final potential energy of each ball increased.\nB: The amount of work required to lift each ball is identical.\nC: The distance of each ball from Earth's center of mass is almost identical.\nD: The gravitational force of each ball on the other cancels out the force of Earth's gravity.",
  "steps": [
    "First, note that both bowling balls have the same mass (7.0 kg), which plays a crucial role in determining the gravitational force acting on them.",
    "Next, consider the force of gravity acting on an object, which is given by the equation F = m * g, where F is the gravitational force, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. As both balls have the same mass, they will experience nearly the same gravitational force regardless of their height above the floor, assuming they are not extremely far from the center of the Earth.",
    "Now, assess the choices. Choice C states that the distance of each ball from Earth's center of mass is almost identical, which is true since both heights (1.0 m and 2.0 m) are very small compared to Earth's radius (about 6,371 km). This means the gravitational force acting on both balls does not change significantly due to their small height difference.",
    "Evaluate the other choices: Choice A talks about potential energy, which is not directly related to why the gravitational force is nearly identical. Choice B is incorrect because the work done to lift the balls is different since they are lifted to different heights. Choice D misinterprets gravitational interactions between the balls, which do not negate the force of Earth's gravity acting on them."
