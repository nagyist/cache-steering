  "query": "Question: All of the following are part of an animal life cycle except\n\nChoices:\nA: growth.\nB: fertilization.\nC: binary fission.\nD: gamete development.",
  "steps": [
    "First, let's define what an animal life cycle typically includes. It generally consists of stages such as fertilization, growth, reproduction, and development of gametes.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices given. Option A, growth, is definitely part of an animal life cycle, as animals grow from embryos into adults.",
    "Option B, fertilization, is also part of the animal life cycle. It is the process where male and female gametes combine to form a zygote.",
    "Option D, gamete development, is included in the life cycle, as it involves the formation of sperm and egg cells necessary for reproduction.",
    "Now, we look at option C, binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction commonly seen in single-celled organisms but not in animals. Animals do not reproduce by binary fission; thus, this method is not part of the typical animal life cycle."

  "solution": "C"
