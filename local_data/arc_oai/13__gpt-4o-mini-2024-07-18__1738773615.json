  "query": "Question: The male insects in a population are treated to prevent sperm production. Would this reduce this insect population?\n\nChoices:\nA: No, because the insects would still mate.\nB: No, because it would not change the offspring mutation rate.\nC: Yes, because it would sharply decrease the reproduction rate.\nD: Yes, because the males would die.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we consider the impact of treating male insects to prevent sperm production on reproduction.",
    "If male insects cannot produce sperm, they cannot successfully fertilize females.",
    "Without successful fertilization, fewer eggs will develop into larvae, leading to a decrease in the overall population.",
    "Therefore, the treatment would directly reduce the reproduction rate in this insect population."
  ],
  "solution": "C"
