  "query": "Question: Some students used a hot plate to heat 1 L of water from 20\u00b0C to the boiling point of water. The students recorded the temperature of the water each minute until it began to boil. Which of the following provides the most appropriate way to represent the data?\n\nChoices:\nA: a bar graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis\nB: a bar graph with time on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis\nC: a line graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis\nD: a line graph with time on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis",
  "steps": [
    "The students collected data on how the temperature of water changes over time as it heats up. This type of data showcases a relationship where one variable (temperature) changes in response to another variable (time).",
    "Since the temperatures are recorded continuously over time and likely show a trend as the water heats up, a line graph is more appropriate than a bar graph. Line graphs are best for illustrating how a variable changes over a period.",
    "Next, we need to identify which axis should represent which variable. Temperature is the dependent variable (it changes based on time), so it should be plotted on the y-axis. Time, the independent variable (it does not rely on temperature), should be plotted on the x-axis.",
    "Based on this analysis, the most suitable representation for the data collected would be a line graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis."
