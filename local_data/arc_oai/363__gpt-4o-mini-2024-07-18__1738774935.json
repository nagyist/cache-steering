  "query": "Question: Which event most changes an ecosystem in a single day?\n\nChoices:\nA: drought\nB: succession\nC: decomposition\nD: wildfire",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the nature of each option and how quickly it can transform an ecosystem.",
    "Drought occurs gradually over time, impacting water availability but not drastically changing the ecosystem in a single day.",
    "Succession is a process that happens over a long period, taking years to decades, so it does not fit the criteria of a single-day change.",
    "Decomposition is a continuous process, but the changes it brings about occur over time as organic matter breaks down.",
    "Wildfire can result in immediate and dramatic changes to an ecosystem, destroying vegetation, altering habitats, and affecting air quality all in a single day."
