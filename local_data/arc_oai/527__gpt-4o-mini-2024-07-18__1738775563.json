  "query": "Question: Many fertilizers contain organic materials that are helpful to an orchard but have a different effect when rain causes them to run off into a freshwater ecosystem. How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?\n\nChoices:\nA: increasing biodiversity\nB: increasing water clarity\nC: decreasing algae blooms\nD: decreasing oxygen levels",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking about the effect of organic waste from fertilizers on freshwater ecosystems, particularly when they run off into these ecosystems.",
    "Organic waste typically introduces additional nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, into water bodies. This can alter the nutrient balance in the ecosystem.",
    "When nutrients are added to freshwater, they can lead to an overgrowth of algae, known as algal blooms, which are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life.",
    "As these algae die off, their decomposition consumes a significant amount of oxygen in the water, leading to a decrease in oxygen levels. This creates hypoxic conditions that can harm or kill aquatic organisms."
