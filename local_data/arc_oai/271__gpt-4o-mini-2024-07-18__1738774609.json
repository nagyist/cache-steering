  "steps": [
    "Identify what is meant by \"continuation of the species.\" This phrase usually refers to the process of reproduction and the ability of organisms to produce offspring.",
    "Evaluate each of the options provided to determine which body system is directly related to reproduction.",
    "Consider that the reproductive system is responsible for producing gametes (sperm and eggs) and facilitating the processes of fertilization and pregnancy, thus allowing for the continuation of species.",
    "The other options (digestive, nervous, and excretory systems) do not primarily focus on the function of reproduction and thus do not align with the phrase \"continuation of the species.\""
