  "steps": [
    "The farmer wants to determine the effect of fertilizer on crop health. To assess this effect properly, he needs to establish a baseline observation of the current condition of his crops.",
    "Recording the appearance of the crops before applying any fertilizers will allow the farmer to compare any changes in the crops' health after the application of fertilizer.",
    "The other options either do not directly relate to assessing the effect of fertilizer or might complicate the situation by introducing variations (like trying different fertilizers at once or changing the crop type)."
