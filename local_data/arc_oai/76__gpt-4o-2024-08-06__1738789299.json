  "query": "Question: Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in all living organisms. Which describes the greatest difference between the cells of a baby gorilla and the cells of an adult gorilla?\n\nChoices:\nA: The adult has more cells than the baby.\nB: The baby has simpler cells than an adult.\nC: The baby has smaller cells than the adult.\nD: The adult has different types of cells than the baby.",
  "steps": [
    "First, understand that in multicellular organisms, the number of cells increases as the organism grows from a baby to an adult.",
    "The adult gorilla will have more cells overall than the baby gorilla due to growth and development.",
    "The complexity of the cells does not change significantly from baby to adult. Both have complex eukaryotic cells with similar functions necessary for life.",
    "The size of the cells themselves generally remains constant; cell size is typically maintained to be optimal for function and efficiency rather than changing dramatically from baby to adult.",
    "While differentiation occurs with growth, the basic types of differentiated cells (e.g., muscle, nerve, skin) needed to function do not dramatically change as they grow from a baby to an adult."
