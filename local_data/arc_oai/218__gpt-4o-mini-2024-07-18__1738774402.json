  "query": "Question: Which of the following is the best evidence that an area of land was once covered by a glacier?\n\nChoices:\nA: limestone caverns\nB: marine fossils\nC: abrasion of surface rocks\nD: peeling slabs of rock",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which evidence indicates that an area was once covered by a glacier, I need to understand the features caused by glacial activity. Glaciers erode and shape the land, leaving specific marks and features behind.",
    "Limestone caverns (Choice A) are formed from limestone dissolution and are not directly related to glacial activity. Marine fossils (Choice B) indicate past marine environments, not glacial ones. Peeling slabs of rock (Choice D) may occur due to other weathering processes, not necessarily glacial.",
    "Abrasion of surface rocks (Choice C) is a process caused by glaciers scraping and grinding against the land, leaving behind marks and smoothed surfaces. This directly indicates glacial activity."
