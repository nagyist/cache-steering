  "query": "Question: A student is investigating changes in the states of matter. The student fills a graduated cylinder with 50 milliliters of packed snow. The graduated cylinder has a mass of 50 grams when empty and 95 grams when filled with the snow. The packed snow changes to liquid water when the snow is put in a warm room. Which statement best describes this process?\n\nChoices:\nA: Cooling causes the snow to melt.\nB: Cooling causes the snow to freeze.\nC: Heating causes the snow to freeze.\nD: Heating causes the snow to melt.",
  "steps": [
    "The student starts with packed snow, which is in a solid state, and places it in a warm room.",
    "The warm room provides heat, which leads to a temperature increase in the packed snow.",
    "With the increase in temperature, the packed snow undergoes a phase change from solid (snow) to liquid (water).",
    "Since the process of snow changing to water occurs due to an increase in temperature, the correct choice must involve heating leading to melting."

  "solution": "D"
