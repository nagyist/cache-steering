  "query": "Question: Students want to plant a lemon tree at their school, but the cold winter temperatures in Massachusetts would kill the tree. Which of the following is the best solution to this problem?\n\nChoices:\nA: planting several lemon trees together in a row\nB: building a greenhouse to shelter the lemon tree\nC: giving the lemon tree extra fertilizer in the winter\nD: tying a stake to the lemon tree for support during the winter",
  "steps": [
    "The problem is that cold winter temperatures in Massachusetts would kill a lemon tree. Therefore, we need a solution that provides protection from the cold.",
    "Option A suggests planting several lemon trees together in a row. This does not provide any additional protection from the cold and would not resolve the issue.",
    "Option B proposes building a greenhouse to shelter the lemon tree. This option would offer protection from the cold temperatures, allowing the tree to survive winter conditions.",
    "Option C involves giving the lemon tree extra fertilizer in winter. While fertilizer may promote growth, it does not protect the tree from cold temperatures and therefore is not an effective solution.",
    "Option D suggests tying a stake to the lemon tree for support. This supports the tree physically but does not address the issue of cold temperatures, which is the main concern."
