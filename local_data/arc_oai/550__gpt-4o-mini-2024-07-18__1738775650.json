  "query": "Question: Which form of water is most likely to appear when the temperature is below freezing?\n\nChoices:\nA: fog\nB: rain\nC: snow\nD: clouds",
  "steps": [
    "When the temperature is below freezing, water can exist in different states based on the environmental conditions.",
    "Fog is composed of tiny water droplets suspended in the air, and it generally forms when temperatures are above freezing.",
    "Rain is liquid water that falls from clouds and occurs when temperatures are above freezing, thus it is not likely when it is below freezing.",
    "Snow forms when water vapor in the atmosphere freezes and falls to the ground in the form of flakes, which is common when temperatures are below freezing.",
    "Clouds can be present at various temperatures, but they are not a solid form of water and do not specifically indicate conditions below freezing, as they can exist in both freezing and above freezing temperatures."
