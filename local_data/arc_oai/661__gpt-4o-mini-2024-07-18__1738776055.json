  "query": "Question: Which event can cause a large rock to become soil over time?\n\nChoices:\nA: decaying\nB: an earthquake\nC: a landslide\nD: weathering",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the process that can transform a large rock into soil over time.",
    "Decaying (A) refers to the breakdown of organic material, which is not directly related to rocks becoming soil.",
    "An earthquake (B) can cause a sudden movement of rocks but does not turn them into soil over time.",
    "A landslide (C) can displace rocks but again doesn't convert them into soil in a gradual sense.",
    "Weathering (D) is the process that breaks down rocks into smaller particles, eventually leading to soil formation over time."
