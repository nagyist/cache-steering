  "query": "Question: Which marine ecosystem is independent of sunlight?\n\nChoices:\nA: estuary\nB: whale fall\nC: black smoker\nD: open ocean",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze each marine ecosystem to determine their reliance on sunlight for energy.",
    "An estuary is typically a transition zone where freshwater from rivers meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean, and it generally relies on sunlight for photosynthesis in plants and phytoplankton.",
    "A whale fall occurs when a whale dies and its carcass sinks to the ocean floor, supporting a unique community of organisms, and this ecosystem can exist independently of sunlight once the whale decomposes, as it relies on the nutrients provided by the whale.",
    "Black smokers (or hydrothermal vents) are areas on the ocean floor where heated, mineral-rich water is expelled from the Earth's crust. These ecosystems are sustained by chemosynthesis, allowing them to thrive independently of sunlight.",
    "The open ocean, especially in its deeper parts, also relies on sunlight to some extent for phytoplankton growth, particularly in the sunlight-receiving upper layers.",
    "Considering the options, both whale fall and black smoker ecosystems can exist independently of sunlight. However, black smokers, which depend solely on chemosynthesis from geothermal vents, are more distinctly independent of sunlight than whale falls, which do receive some energy from sunlight during the whale's life."
