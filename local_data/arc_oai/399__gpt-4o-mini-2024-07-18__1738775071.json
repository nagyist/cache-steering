  "query": "Question: Lighting a match and baking a cake are two actions that involve chemical changes. Why are these actions considered chemical changes?\n\nChoices:\nA: They change the state of matter.\nB: They create new substances.\nC: They change volume.\nD: They create energy.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine why lighting a match and baking a cake are considered chemical changes, we must first understand what a chemical change entails. A chemical change involves a transformation where the composition of substances changes, resulting in the formation of new substances with different properties.",
    "When you light a match, the heat initiates a combustion reaction, leading to the formation of ash, smoke, and gases (like carbon dioxide), which are new substances that did not exist before the match was lit.",
    "Similarly, baking a cake involves chemical reactions, such as the expansion of gases and the reaction of baking powder with moisture and heat, leading to the creation of new compounds and substances (like carbonation and complex proteins) in the baked cake.",
    "Both actions clearly involve the creation of new substances, which is why they are classified as chemical changes rather than physical changes."
