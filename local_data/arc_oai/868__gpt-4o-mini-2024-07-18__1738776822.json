  "query": "Question: Which of the following is a by-product of cellular respiration in animals?\n\nChoices:\nA: oxygen\nB: heat\nC: sugar\nD: protein",
  "steps": [
    "Cellular respiration in animals breaks down glucose (sugar) to produce energy.",
    "During this process, one of the by-products is carbon dioxide and energy is released in the form of heat.",
    "Oxygen is used up in cellular respiration rather than produced, so it is not a by-product.",
    "Sugar is the starting material consumed during cellular respiration, not a by-product.",
    "Proteins are not by-products of cellular respiration; rather, they are macromolecules used in various cellular functions.",
    "Therefore, the only viable by-product listed among the choices is heat."

  "solution": "B"
