  "query": "Question: Muscle cells have the ability to store and release large amounts of energy. Which body function is best served by this release of energy?\n\nChoices:\nA: exchanging gases\nB: moving body parts\nC: absorbing nutrients\nD: sending nerve impulses",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the function of muscle cells. Muscle cells contract and perform the work required for movement, which means they need energy to function effectively.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices given. The ability to store and release energy is most relevant to physical activity and movement.",
    "Look at option A. Exchanging gases generally involves respiratory function rather than energy release by muscle cells directly.",
    "Now consider option C. Absorbing nutrients is primarily the role of the digestive system, not muscle energy.",
    "Next, think about option D. Sending nerve impulses involves nervous system activity, which doesn't primarily depend on the energy stored in muscle cells.",
    "Finally, option B aligns with the function of muscle cells. They require energy to contract and facilitate movement of body parts, which is their primary role in the body."
