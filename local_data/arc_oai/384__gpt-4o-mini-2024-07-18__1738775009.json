  "query": "Question: When gasoline in a car engine is burned, only about 15 percent of the gasoline is converted into mechanical energy. This is because most of the energy in the gasoline is\n\nChoices:\nA: transformed into heat.\nB: stored for use at a later time.\nC: changed into chemical energy.\nD: used to make the vehicle move.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that only 15 percent of the gasoline is converted into mechanical energy when burned in a car engine.",
    "Most of the energy in gasoline is not used for mechanical energy, indicating that the remaining energy is not effectively utilized for work.",
    "Among the provided options, \"transformed into heat\" makes sense, as much of the energy is lost as heat in the burning process and not captured for work.",
    "The other options, such as stored for later use, changed into chemical energy, or used to make the vehicle move, do not accurately describe what happens to the majority of the energy from gasoline."
