  "query": "Question: Rain forests contain more species of trees than any other biome. However, scientists have found that the soil of the forest floor is relatively nutrient poor. What could most likely account for this?\n\nChoices:\nA: The lack of weathering reduces the availability of the minerals.\nB: The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.\nC: The forest floor does not get enough sunlight.\nD: The animals eat the nutrients.",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that rain forests contain a high number of tree species but have nutrient-poor soil, suggesting a relationship between the dense vegetation and soil nutrient levels.",
    "Option A suggests that lack of weathering is the reason for nutrient shortages. While weathering can provide minerals, the density of vegetation in rainforests generally leads to high organic content rather than a direct lack of weathering.",
    "Option B posits that the nutrients are being utilized by the plant life. In ecosystems like rainforests, plants rapidly absorb nutrients from the soil, which can lead to nutrient depletion, especially in the upper layers of the soil where roots are concentrated.",
    "Option C indicates that insufficient sunlight on the forest floor contributes to the nutrient scarcity. However, the primary productivity of rainforest plants occurs at canopy level where sunlight is abundant, and sunlight deficiency mostly affects lower-level growth, not the nutrient levels per se.",
    "Option D states that animals consume the nutrients. While animals do interact with the nutrients in the ecosystem (through consumption and excretion), their role is less significant in explaining why the soil itself remains nutrient-poor compared to the plant utilization aspect."
