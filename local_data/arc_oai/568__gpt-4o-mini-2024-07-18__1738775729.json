  "query": "Question: Some types of medicines can be used to cure people when they are sick. Some medicines, however, may cause bad reactions to the people taking them. This difference is an example of\n\nChoices:\nA: technology being used to help heal people.\nB: medical procedures being used to hurt people.\nC: expensive medicines being used for many purposes.\nD: the solution to one problem causing another problem.",
  "steps": [
    "The question discusses how some medicines help cure people while others can cause bad reactions. This implies a dual effect of medicine: positive and negative.",
    "The essence of this dual effect suggests that while a solution (the medicine) exists for a problem (illness), it can also create a new problem (adverse reactions).",
    "Among the answer choices, D clearly indicates that a solution to one problem (healing sickness) can lead to another problem (bad reactions). This fits perfectly with the scenario described in the question."
