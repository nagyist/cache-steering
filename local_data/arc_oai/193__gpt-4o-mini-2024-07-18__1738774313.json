  "query": "Question: Stars generate large amounts of energy when nuclei with small mass undergo fusion to form nuclei with larger mass. Which of the four basic forces of the universe is responsible for the energy released during fusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: weak force\nB: strong force\nC: gravitational force\nD: electromagnetic force",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks which fundamental force is responsible for the energy released during the fusion of nuclei in stars.",
    "Fusion occurs when light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing energy in the process.",
    "The fundamental forces that are relevant to nuclear interactions include the strong force, the weak force, gravitational force, and electromagnetic force.",
    "The strong force is what binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, overcoming the electromagnetic repulsion between positively charged protons.",
    "During fusion, the strong force plays a crucial role in allowing nuclei to come close enough together for fusion to occur, leading to energy release.",
    "The weak force is responsible for processes like beta decay, but does not play a direct role in fusion.",
    "Gravitational force and electromagnetic force do not facilitate the binding of nuclear particles in the way that the strong force does during fusion."
