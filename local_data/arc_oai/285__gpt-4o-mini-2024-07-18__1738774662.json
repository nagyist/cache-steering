  "query": "Question: All elements found on the left side of the Periodic Table of the Elements have what properties in common?\n\nChoices:\nA: They are solids at room temperature.\nB: They don't conduct electricity.\nC: They are brittle and dull.\nD: They are radioactive.",
  "steps": [
    "The left side of the Periodic Table primarily contains metals, such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals.",
    "Most metals are typically solid at room temperature, with a few exceptions, such as mercury.",
    "Metals are generally good conductors of electricity, which contradicts option B.",
    "Metals are usually not brittle and dull; they tend to be malleable and shiny, which makes option C incorrect.",
    "While some elements on the left side may be radioactive, this property is not a universal trait of all left-side elements, so option D is also incorrect."
