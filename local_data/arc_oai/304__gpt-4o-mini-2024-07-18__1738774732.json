  "query": "Question: A scientist on a field trip discovered a new organism. She examined its cells under a microscope and observed several different structures, including a nucleus, a cell wall, and some chloroplasts. This organism would correctly be classified in which of the following kingdoms?\n\nChoices:\nA: Animalia\nB: Monera\nC: Plantae\nD: Fungi",
  "steps": [
    "The organism has a nucleus, which indicates that it is a eukaryote, ruling out the kingdom Monera since Monera consists of prokaryotic organisms.",
    "The presence of a cell wall suggests that the organism is not part of the Animalia kingdom, as animals do not have cell walls.",
    "Chloroplasts are present in the organism, which are specialized structures for photosynthesis typically found in plants.",
    "Given that the organism has a nucleus, a cell wall, and chloroplasts, it fits the characteristics of the Plantae kingdom, which encompasses organisms that perform photosynthesis and have cell walls made of cellulose."
