  "query": "Question: Which of the following is least likely to change from a solid state to a liquid state when heat is applied?\n\nChoices:\nA: butter\nB: paper\nC: ice\nD: candle wax",
  "steps": [
    "First, I'll analyze each option to determine how they respond to heat. Butter is a fat that melts into a liquid when heated, so it changes from solid to liquid.",
    "Next, paper does not melt into a liquid; instead, it burns when exposed to heat. Therefore, it is unlikely to change to a liquid state under normal heating conditions.",
    "Then, ice melts into water when heat is applied, so it undergoes a transition from solid to liquid.",
    "Finally, candle wax also melts into a liquid when heat is applied, similar to butter.",
    "Comparing all the options, paper is the only material that does not transition to a liquid state when heat is applied rather than melting or converting."
