  "query": "Question: Which equation is correctly balanced for hydrogen and oxygen reacting to form water?\n\nChoices:\nA: H_{2} + O_{2} -> H_{2}O\nB: 2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O\nC: 4H + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O\nD: H_{2} + O -> H_{2}O",
  "steps": [
    "Start by determining how many hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms are present in each equation and whether they match the number of atoms after the reaction forms water (H\u2082O).",
    "For option A (H\u2082 + O\u2082 -> H\u2082O): The left side has 2 H and 2 O, while the right side has 2 H and 1 O. This is not balanced.",
    "For option B (2H\u2082 + O\u2082 -> 2H\u2082O): The left side has 4 H and 2 O, while the right side has 4 H and 2 O (2 H\u2082O has 2 H and 1 O each). This is balanced.",
    "For option C (4H + O\u2082 -> 2H\u2082O): The left side has 4 single hydrogen atoms (4 H) and 2 O, while the right side has 4 H and 2 O. This is also balanced.",
    "For option D (H\u2082 + O -> H\u2082O): The left side has 2 H and 1 O, while the right side has 2 H and 1 O. This is balanced as well.",
    "Comparing the balanced equations, options B, C, and D are correctly balanced, but only one is a conventional representation involving molecules rather than individual atoms like option C."
