  "query": "Question: Tyrone put two stones in a plastic bottle of water and shook it. After he stopped shaking the bottle, he observed that small pieces of the stones were floating in the water. What is the best prediction he can make based on this observation? If shaking the bottle causes pieces of stones to break off,\n\nChoices:\nA: then using cold water will break off more pieces.\nB: then using hot water will make the stones change colors.\nC: then shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces.\nD: then shaking for a shorter amount of time will make the rocks change colors.",
  "steps": [
    "The observation states that small pieces of the stones are floating in the water after shaking the bottle.",
    "This implies that the act of shaking the bottle causes the stones to break down into smaller pieces.",
    "Thus, it can be inferred that if the shaking continues for a longer duration, more pieces could potentially break off from the stones due to the ongoing agitation.",
    "Looking at the choices, option C states that shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces, which aligns with the observed effect of shaking."

  "solution": "C"
