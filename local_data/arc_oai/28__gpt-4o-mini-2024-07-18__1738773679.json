  "query": "Question: Which of the following is an observation about grasshoppers that a science class could have made on their nature walk?\n\nChoices:\nA: The grasshoppers will live longest in a container filled with plants.\nB: The grasshoppers are green with long back legs and antennae.\nC: The grasshoppers will probably eat more grass than tree leaves.\nD: The grasshoppers all hatched from eggs laid the year before.",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an observation about grasshoppers that could be made during a nature walk, meaning it should be an observable characteristic or behavior.",
    "Option A discusses the grasshoppers' lifespan in a container with plants, which is not an observation that can be made on a nature walk but rather a conclusion based on controlled conditions.",
    "Option B describes the physical characteristics of the grasshoppers (green color, long back legs, and antennae), which can be directly observed during the nature walk.",
    "Option C makes an inference about their eating habits, which is not directly observable but rather speculative based on their nature.",
    "Option D talks about the hatching of grasshoppers from eggs laid the previous year, which is also not something that can be observed during a nature walk."
