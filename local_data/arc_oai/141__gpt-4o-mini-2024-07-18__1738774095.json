  "query": "Question: Las Vegas has access to renewable resources for generation of electrical power, which includes hydroelectric power. Which of these energy resources is renewable and available to generate electricity in Las Vegas without degrading the environment?\n\nChoices:\nA: petroleum\nB: geothermal\nC: nuclear\nD: solar",
  "steps": [
    "Hydroelectric power is renewable, but it is not listed as one of the choices. We need to identify which of the listed options are renewable.",
    "Petroleum is a fossil fuel, and its extraction and consumption degrade the environment, making it non-renewable.",
    "Geothermal energy is considered renewable as it harnesses heat from within the Earth, which is sustainable and has a lower environmental impact.",
    "Nuclear power, while not producing greenhouse gas emissions during operation, relies on uranium and has concerns related to waste and potential hazards, thus is not classified as renewable.",
    "Solar energy harnesses sunlight, which is abundant and sustainable, making it a renewable resource with minimal environmental degradation.",
    "Now comparing geothermal and solar, both are renewable. However, the question asks for energy sources that are available in Las Vegas specifically.",
    "Las Vegas has ample sunlight, making solar energy a viable and widely used renewable resource in the area."
