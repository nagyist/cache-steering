    "Conduction is the transfer of heat through a material without the movement of the material itself. It typically occurs in solids.",
    "Option A (a space heater turned on) involves convection and radiation, not conduction, as it heats the air around it.",
    "Option B (water boiling on the stove) involves convection within the water as it heats, rather than solely conduction.",
    "Option C (sunlight shining through the window) does not involve conduction; it is primarily an example of radiation.",
    "Option D (a metal spoon warming in a pot of hot soup) demonstrates conduction, as the heat from the hot soup is transferred directly to the metal spoon."
