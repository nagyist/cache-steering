  "query": "Question: Mr. Pratt does a science demonstration. He inflates a balloon, places it in a freezer, and then removes it after 10 minutes. Which best describes the balloon's volume when in the freezer and then after being removed and allowed to warm up?\n\nChoices:\nA: expands in the freezer and then contracts as it gets warmer again\nB: contracts in the freezer and then expands as it gets warmer again\nC: expands in the freezer and then keeps that volume when warmed up\nD: contracts in the freezer and then keeps that volume when warmed up",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what happens when a gas is cooled. According to Charles's Law, gas volume decreases as temperature decreases, assuming pressure remains constant.",
    "Next, apply this principle to the scenario: when Mr. Pratt places the balloon in the freezer, the cold temperature will cause the gas inside the balloon to lose energy and therefore occupy a smaller volume. The balloon contracts.",
    "After 10 minutes, when the balloon is removed from the freezer and allowed to warm up, the gas inside the balloon will gain energy as the temperature increases. As a result, the volume of the gas will also increase, causing the balloon to expand again.",
    "Consider the choices provided: The correct description is that the balloon contracts in the freezer and then expands as it gets warmer again."
