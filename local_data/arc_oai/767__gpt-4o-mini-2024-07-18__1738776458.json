  "query": "Question: The weight of heavy machinery compacts soil, especially when it is wet. Why do farmers avoid driving their machinery across wet ground?\n\nChoices:\nA: Compacted soil will absorb too much water.\nB: Plants cannot grow when soil is compacted.\nC: Minerals are destroyed when soil is compacted.\nD: Compacted soil increases soil acidity.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the impact of compacted soil on water absorption. Compacted soil generally prevents water from penetrating, leading to poor drainage.",
    "Next, evaluate the direct effects of compaction on plant growth. Compacted soil can restrict root growth and reduce oxygen availability, which can hinder plant growth effectively.",
    "Then, analyze the options related to minerals and soil acidity. While compaction can affect soil structure, it does not directly destroy minerals, nor does it inherently increase soil acidity.",
    "Based on the above steps, the primary concern for farmers when driving machinery on wet ground is the negative impact of compaction on plant growth and soil health."
