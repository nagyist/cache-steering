  "query": "Question: Mrs. Gordon's class studies maple trees. Which property can the students measure with a meter stick?\n\nChoices:\nA: the mass of a leaf\nB: the volume of its sap\nC: the length of a branch\nD: the temperature of its bark",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about properties that can be measured using a meter stick, which is generally used to measure linear distances or lengths.",
    "Option A mentions measuring the mass of a leaf. Mass is measured using scales, not a meter stick.",
    "Option B refers to measuring the volume of sap. Volume is measured using graduated cylinders or similar containers, but not a meter stick.",
    "Option C states measuring the length of a branch, which is a linear distance and can be accurately measured with a meter stick.",
    "Option D talks about measuring the temperature of bark. Temperature is measured with a thermometer, not a meter stick."
