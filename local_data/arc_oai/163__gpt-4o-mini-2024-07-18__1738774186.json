  "query": "Question: Tall plants are dominant to short plants. What is the outcome if two short plants are crossed?\n\nChoices:\nA: all tall plants\nB: all short plants\nC: half tall plants, half short plants\nD: 1/4 tall plants, 1/3 short plants",
  "steps": [
    "Tall plants are represented by the dominant allele (T) and short plants by the recessive allele (t).",
    "If two short plants are crossed, their genotypes would both be tt since they can only express the recessive trait.",
    "When two homozygous recessive plants (tt x tt) are crossed, the resulting offspring will also be homozygous recessive (tt).",
    "Therefore, all the offspring from this cross will be short plants because they inherit the recessive allele from both parents."

  "solution": "B"
