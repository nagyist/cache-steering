  "query": "Question: What makes solar energy different from most other energy that people use?\n\nChoices:\nA: Solar energy involves the most dangerous equipment.\nB: Solar energy requires the most complicated technology.\nC: The supply of solar energy will not change for billions of years.\nD: The supply of solar energy causes it to be the cheapest kind of energy.",
  "steps": [
    "First, analyze the nature of solar energy. Unlike fossil fuels, solar energy is renewable and comes from the sun, which is expected to continue shining for billions of years.",
    "Next, consider the choices given. Choice A suggests danger, which is not unique to solar energy as other energies can also involve risks.",
    "Then, evaluate choice B about technology. While solar technology can be complex, it is not inherently more complicated than technologies used for other energy sources, such as nuclear or fossil fuels.",
    "Next, assess choice C. The fact that solar energy is virtually inexhaustible over billions of years indeed distinguishes it from finite resources like coal, oil, and natural gas.",
    "Finally, analyze choice D which states solar energy is the cheapest. While it can be cost-effective, it is subject to change based on economic conditions and is not inherently the cheapest in all contexts."
