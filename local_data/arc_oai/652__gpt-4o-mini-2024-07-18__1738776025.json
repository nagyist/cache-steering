  "query": "Question: A student riding a bicycle observes that it moves faster on a smooth road than on a rough road. This happens because the smooth road has\n\nChoices:\nA: less gravity\nB: more gravity\nC: less friction\nD: more friction",
  "steps": [
    "The student is comparing the speed of the bicycle on two different types of surfaces: smooth and rough.",
    "A smooth road typically has fewer obstacles and irregularities, which can reduce the resistance faced by the bicycle.",
    "Friction is the force that opposes the motion of the bicycle; a smooth surface generally results in less friction compared to a rough surface.",
    "As the friction decreases, the bicycle can move faster because there is less resistance to its motion."

  "solution": "C"
