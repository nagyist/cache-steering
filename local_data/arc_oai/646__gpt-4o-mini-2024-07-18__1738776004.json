  "steps": [
    "First, I need to consider the characteristics of liquids. Liquids are substances that flow and take the shape of their containers.",
    "Next, I need to analyze the answer choices to see which one correctly describes a definite property of liquids.",
    "Option A (flexibility) relates to solids rather than liquids, as liquids cannot be flexible like solids can, so this option can be eliminated.",
    "Option B (temperature) is not a definite property of liquids because temperature can vary; it is not fixed.",
    "Option C (volume) states that liquids have a definite volume, which is true as they occupy a specific amount of space.",
    "Option D (shape) indicates that liquids do not have a definite shape; they take the shape of their container, so this option can also be eliminated."
