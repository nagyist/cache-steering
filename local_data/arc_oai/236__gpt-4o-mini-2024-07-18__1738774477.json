  "query": "Question: Which characteristic can a human offspring inherit?\n\nChoices:\nA: facial scar\nB: blue eyes\nC: long hair\nD: broken leg",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will consider the concept of inheritance in humans, which refers to traits passed down from parents to offspring through genes.",
    "Next, I will evaluate each choice to determine if it can be inherited genetically.",
    "Facial scars (choice A) are typically the result of accidents or injuries and are not inherited traits; therefore, they cannot be passed down genetically.",
    "Blue eyes (choice B) are determined by genetics and can be inherited from one's parents, making this a potential characteristic for human offspring.",
    "Long hair (choice C) is not inherited as a distinct trait in the same manner as eye color and is influenced by various factors including environment and health, making it less a direct inheritance.",
    "A broken leg (choice D) is an injury and occurs due to external factors, so it is also not a genetically inherited characteristic.",
    "Based on this reasoning, the only characteristic that human offspring can inherit genetically is blue eyes (choice B)."
