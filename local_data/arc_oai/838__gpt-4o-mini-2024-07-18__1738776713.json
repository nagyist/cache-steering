  "query": "Question: Which system has layers of smooth muscle tissue that contract to move solid and liquid nutrients and waste through the body?\n\nChoices:\nA: respiratory\nB: skeletal\nC: endocrine\nD: digestive",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which system has layers of smooth muscle tissue, we first need to recall that smooth muscle is primarily found in the walls of hollow organs and is involuntary.",
    "The question mentions moving solid and liquid nutrients and waste through the body, which suggests a system responsible for processing and transporting materials.",
    "Among the choices given, the respiratory system involves the movement of air, the skeletal system is related to voluntary muscle movements and support, and the endocrine system deals with hormone production and regulation, not directly with nutrient or waste movement.",
    "The digestive system, however, is specifically known for its role in breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and moving waste products through peristaltic movements, which involve the contraction of smooth muscle layers."
