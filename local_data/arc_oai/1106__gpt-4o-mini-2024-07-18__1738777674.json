  "query": "Question: Which source of data about Nevada resources is likely to be most current and reliable?\n\nChoices:\nA: a science encyclopedia\nB: an article in a local newspaper\nC: a government-maintained website\nD: a student's classroom presentation",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the reliability of the sources listed. A government-maintained website is typically updated regularly and provides facts based on current research or official data.",
    "Next, evaluate the other options. A science encyclopedia may not have the most current information, as it may not be updated frequently. An article in a local newspaper can provide timely information but may represent a single perspective or may not be as fact-checked. A student's classroom presentation might not be reliable, as it depends on the accuracy of the student's research and understanding.",
    "After weighing the reliability and potential accuracy of the sources, it becomes clear that the government-maintained website stands out for providing the most accurate and up-to-date information about Nevada resources."
