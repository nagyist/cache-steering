  "query": "Question: The weather forecast says a heavy snowstorm is coming later today. Which weather observation is likely just before the snow?\n\nChoices:\nA: clear sky\nB: thick grey clouds\nC: small white clouds\nD: warm temperature",
  "steps": [
    "A heavy snowstorm typically follows the buildup of clouds and weather systems that indicate a change in weather. Thus, we should expect to see clouds that precede snowfall.",
    "Of the choices provided, thick grey clouds are most commonly associated with impending snow, as they indicate moisture in the atmosphere. This supports the forecast of a snowstorm.",
    "Clear skies would not be likely just before a heavy snowstorm, as they indicate stable weather conditions with no immediate precipitation. Small white clouds typically do not precede heavy snow, and warm temperatures are unlikely in the lead-up to snow."
