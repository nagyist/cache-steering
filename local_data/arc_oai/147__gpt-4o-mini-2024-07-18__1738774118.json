  "query": "Question: Where does the energy from an earthquake originate?\n\nChoices:\nA: from a sudden increase in solar radiation striking Earth\nB: from the Moon's gravitational pull during a close orbit\nC: from rocks under stress shifting deep inside Earth\nD: from the weight of sediments pushing down on bedrock",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks where the energy from an earthquake originates, which implies looking for a natural geological process rather than an external source.",
    "Option A suggests that the energy comes from solar radiation, which is unrelated to the tectonic processes that cause earthquakes.",
    "Option B mentions the Moon's gravitational pull, but while this can influence tides, it does not directly cause the sudden release of energy that results in an earthquake.",
    "Option D talks about the weight of sediments, but this does not directly explain the inner tectonic processes that lead to earthquakes.",
    "Option C states that the energy comes from rocks under stress shifting deep inside Earth. This aligns with the geological processes that lead to the buildup and release of energy during an earthquake."
