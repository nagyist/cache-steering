  "query": "Question: During which activity will light most likely be refracted?\n\nChoices:\nA: placing a scarf over the shade of a lamp\nB: viewing objects using the side mirror of a car\nC: looking at pebbles through the water in a stream\nD: using a flashlight to light up a forest path at night",
  "steps": [
    "Refraction occurs when light passes through different media, causing it to change speed and direction.",
    "In option A (placing a scarf over the shade of a lamp), the light is mostly being blocked or diffused rather than refracted.",
    "In option B (viewing objects using the side mirror of a car), the light reflects more than it refracts as it hits the mirror surface.",
    "In option C (looking at pebbles through the water in a stream), light transitions from air to water and could create refraction effects that make the pebbles appear displaced.",
    "In option D (using a flashlight to light up a forest path at night), the light is primarily traveling through air, so there is minimal refraction involved."
