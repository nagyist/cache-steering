  "query": "Question: Which of the following distinguishes the organisms in the kingdom Fungi from other eukaryotic organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fungi are unicellular.\nB: Fungi reproduce sexually.\nC: Fungi obtain nutrients by absorption.\nD: Fungi make food through photosynthesis.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to identify a distinguishing characteristic unique to fungi that sets them apart from other eukaryotic organisms.",
    "Option A states that fungi are unicellular. However, fungi can be both unicellular (like yeast) and multicellular (like molds and mushrooms), so this is not a unique characteristic.",
    "Option B mentions that fungi reproduce sexually. While fungi can reproduce sexually, so can many other eukaryotic organisms (like plants and animals), making this not exclusive to fungi.",
    "Option C states that fungi obtain nutrients by absorption. This is indeed a key characteristic of fungi, as they digest food externally and absorb the resulting nutrients, which sets them apart from other groups like plants that use photosynthesis.",
    "Option D claims that fungi make food through photosynthesis. This is false, as fungi are heterotrophs and do not perform photosynthesis; that characteristic belongs to plants."
