  "steps": [
    "The question states that coal began as organic material deposited in a swamp, which indicates a biological origin rather than a geological one.",
    "Choice A suggests that coal is made mostly of skeletal remains of animals, which is incorrect because coal primarily comes from plant materials, not animals.",
    "Choice B proposes that coal is formed from magma that has solidified over time, which contradicts the statement as coal originates from organic plant matter rather than molten rock.",
    "Choice C states that coal quickly becomes petrified when water is removed. However, petrification typically refers to minerals replacing organic material over a lengthy geological period rather than coal formation, which occurs under specific conditions in swamps.",
    "Choice D states that geologic processes continue over millions of years, which aligns with the idea of coal formation taking a significant amount of time due to compression and heat acting on the organic material."
