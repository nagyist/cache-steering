  "query": "Question: Cellular respiration results in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules for energy. The most efficient form of cellular respiration would result in the production of ATP along with which substances?\n\nChoices:\nA: oxygen and energy\nB: glucose and glycogen\nC: lactic acid and alcohol\nD: carbon dioxide and water",
  "steps": [
    "Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that converts biochemical energy from nutrients into ATP, with byproducts.",
    "In aerobic cellular respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, resulting in ATP production along with carbon dioxide and water.",
    "The question asks for the most efficient form of cellular respiration, which implies utilizing oxygen (aerobic respiration) rather than fermentation processes that yield lactic acid or alcohol.",
    "Among the provided choices, option D (carbon dioxide and water) aligns with the products of aerobic cellular respiration alongside ATP."
