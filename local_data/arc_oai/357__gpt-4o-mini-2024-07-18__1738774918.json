  "query": "Question: Which of these most likely has the GREATEST mass?\n\nChoices:\nA: Chicken\nB: Puppy\nC: Lizard\nD: Horse",
  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the average mass of each option provided: chicken, puppy, lizard, and horse. Generally, a chicken weighs significantly less than the other animals.",
    "Next, I'll consider the typical weight of a puppy. Although some puppy breeds can be heavy, most weigh less than adult animals of larger breeds.",
    "Now, I will evaluate the lizard option. Lizards generally do not have a high mass, as most species are relatively small.",
    "After reviewing these three, I will look at horses. Adult horses are known to be very large animals, usually weighing between 900 to over 2000 pounds depending on the breed.",
    "Comparing all these animals, horses clearly have the greatest mass due to their size and weight."
