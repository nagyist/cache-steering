  "steps": [
    "The question asks where a sidewalk would feel hottest during a warm, clear day.",
    "A sidewalk exposed to direct sunlight would receive more heat from the sun compared to areas that are shaded or obstructed.",
    "In contrast, areas under a picnic table and in the shade would be cooler due to limited exposure to sunlight.",
    "A puddle would create a cooling effect due to evaporation and the presence of water, which does not retain heat like asphalt does.",
    "Thus, the option that suggests the sidewalk feeling hottest is the one exposed to the most sunlight."
