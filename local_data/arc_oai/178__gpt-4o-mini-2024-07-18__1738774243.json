  "query": "Question: What is the primary source of energy that causes evaporation of water from the surface of bodies of water?\n\nChoices:\nA: solar radiation\nB: transpiration by plants\nC: heat from nearby land masses\nD: convection currents in the water",
  "steps": [
    "The question is asking for the primary source of energy that leads to the evaporation of water.",
    "Evaporation occurs when water molecules gain enough energy to change from a liquid to a vapor state.",
    "The primary source of energy for most natural processes on Earth, including the evaporation of water, is solar radiation.",
    "While transpiration, heat from land, and convection currents can play roles in the water cycle, they do not serve as the primary energy source for evaporation."
