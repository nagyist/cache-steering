  "query": "Question: Which is true about the Sun and Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: Earth gives light and heat energy to the Sun.\nB: Earth gives only heat energy to the Sun.\nC: The Sun gives light and heat energy to Earth.\nD: The Sun gives only light energy to Earth.",
  "steps": [
    "The Sun is a massive star that produces light and heat through nuclear fusion in its core.",
    "The Earth orbits the Sun and receives energy from it, which is crucial for life on our planet.",
    "Without the Sun's light and heat, the Earth would not have the necessary conditions to support life.",
    "Choices A and B suggest that the Earth gives energy to the Sun, which is incorrect; the Sun provides energy to the Earth, not the other way around.",
    "Choice D states that the Sun gives only light energy to Earth, while in reality, it provides both light and heat energy.",
    "Therefore, the correct statement is that the Sun gives light and heat energy to Earth."
