  "query": "Question: Paleontologists construct a model of a dinosaur from its fossil bones and teeth. The fossil bones and teeth can help the paleontologists to infer all of the following about the dinosaur except\n\nChoices:\nA: height of the dinosaur.\nB: type of food the dinosaur ate.\nC: length of the dinosaur.\nD: skin color of the dinosaur.",
  "steps": [
    "Paleontologists can analyze the size and structure of fossil bones to estimate the height of the dinosaur.",
    "The teeth structure of the dinosaur can provide insights into its diet, indicating whether it was herbivorous, carnivorous, or omnivorous, thus inferring the type of food it ate.",
    "The size and proportions of the fossil bones can also help in estimating the length of the dinosaur.",
    "However, paleontologists cannot determine the skin color of the dinosaur from fossil bones and teeth, as color is not preserved in fossils."
