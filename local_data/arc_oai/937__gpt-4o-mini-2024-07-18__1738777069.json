  "query": "Question: Which of the following represents the velocity of a moving object?\n\nChoices:\nA: 40\nB: 40 m north\nC: 40 m/s\nD: 40 m/s north",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand that velocity is defined as the speed of an object in a specific direction.",
    "Next, we analyze the choices provided to determine which one includes both magnitude and direction, as required for velocity.",
    "Choice A (40) lacks units and direction, so it does not represent velocity.",
    "Choice B (40 m north) specifies direction (north) but does not include the unit of time which is needed for velocity.",
    "Choice C (40 m/s) specifies a speed but does not provide any directional information, making it only a measure of speed, not velocity.",
    "Choice D (40 m/s north) includes both the correct speed (40 m/s) and the directional component (north), making it a complete representation of velocity."

  "solution": "D"
