  "query": "Question: The classification of some organisms has changed. Which new process is used to reclassify organisms?\n\nChoices:\nA: Organisms are now given Latin-based scientific names.\nB: Structures are now examined at the molecular level.\nC: Organisms are now divided into three kingdoms.\nD: Structures are now used to classify organisms.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what is meant by reclassification of organisms. Traditionally, classification was primarily based on observable anatomical features.",
    "Next, examine the modern methods of classification, particularly how advances in biology have shifted perspectives. Molecular biology has allowed scientists to analyze DNA and proteins, which offer deeper insights into relationships between organisms.",
    "Now, evaluate the provided options. Option A refers to scientific naming, which has not fundamentally changed. Option C suggests dividing into three kingdoms, but this reflects earlier classifications and may not be the current method. Option D mentions structural classification, which was the previous method, not a new one.",
    "This leads us to Option B, which mentions examining structures at the molecular level - a newer approach that has transformed the way organisms are classified by looking at genetic material, thus revealing more accurate relationships."
