  "query": "Question: Which of these is an example of an adaptation for defense from predators?\n\nChoices:\nA: giraffe's long neck\nB: baby deer's spots\nC: otter's oily fur\nD: fish's gills",
  "steps": [
    "Identify what adaptations for defense from predators involve. They typically help animals avoid being detected or attacked by predators.",
    "Evaluate each choice based on its relationship to defense from predators.",
    "A: A giraffe's long neck primarily helps it reach high foliage for feeding rather than serve as a defense against predators.",
    "B: A baby deer\u2019s spots help it blend into its environment (camouflage), which serves as a defense mechanism against predators.",
    "C: An otter\u2019s oily fur is advantageous for insulation in water and may help in movement but does not directly serve as a defense against predators.",
    "D: Fish's gills are necessary for breathing and do not provide a defense mechanism against predators.",
    "Among the options, baby deer's spots clearly represent an adaptation that helps in avoiding predators through camouflage."
