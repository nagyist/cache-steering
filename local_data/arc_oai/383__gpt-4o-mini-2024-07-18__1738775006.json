  "query": "Question: A student is shown a slide of cells from a species of producer in a food web. The student observes that the cells have chloroplasts. What conclusion about the food web is best supported by these findings?\n\nChoices:\nA: The producers capture energy from sunlight.\nB: The food web is found in a terrestrial ecosystem.\nC: The producers in the web are single-celled organisms.\nD: The food web contains many herbivores and omnivores.",
  "steps": [
    "The student's observation of cells containing chloroplasts indicates that these cells are capable of photosynthesis, which is characteristic of producers (like plants and algae) that capture energy from sunlight.",
    "Since chloroplasts are primarily involved in the process of photosynthesis, the most direct conclusion we can draw is that these producers are indeed capturing energy from sunlight.",
    "The other options do not directly relate to the observation of chloroplasts. For instance, while producers can be single-celled organisms, not all producers are, and the presence of chloroplasts does not specify anything about herbivores or omnivores. Additionally, we cannot conclude the type of ecosystem based solely on the presence of chloroplasts."
