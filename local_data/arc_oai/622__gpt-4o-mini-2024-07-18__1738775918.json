  "query": "Question: At what level of organization does damage compromise the function of the whole system?\n\nChoices:\nA: a cell\nB: an organ\nC: a tissue\nD: an organelle",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the levels of biological organization, which include organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and systems.",
    "Next, we consider what it means for damage to compromise the function of the whole system. Damage at a higher level of organization is likely to affect multiple components below it.",
    "If damage occurs at the level of an organ, it can affect the overall function of the system it operates within, as organs work together to perform specific functions.",
    "If damage occurs at the level of a tissue, while it may impact the organ, the entire system's function might not be entirely compromised, depending on redundancy in organ functions.",
    "Similarly, damage at the cellular level (choice A) or the organelle level (choice D) would predominantly impair the specific function of those units but would not necessarily affect the entire body system.",
    "Thus, the level at which damage jeopardizes the overall function of the system is best illustrated when organs are affected, as they are integral components of systems."
