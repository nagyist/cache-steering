  "query": "Question: Many horses grow a heavy coat in autumn and shed that coat in spring. Scientists were not sure if temperature or the amount of daylight per day (called the photoperiod) caused the change. So, they conducted an experiment and concluded that the change in photoperiod was responsible for the biological changes. Shedding caused by which set of conditions would have helped them arrive at this conclusion?\n\nChoices:\nA: a constant photoperiod, but varied temperatures\nB: a varied photoperiod, and varied temperatures\nC: a constant photoperiod, and a constant temperature\nD: a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature",
  "steps": [
    "The question is about determining which conditions would help support the conclusion that photoperiod is responsible for horses shedding their coats.",
    "If the photoperiod is varied while keeping the temperature constant, the researchers could observe how changes in the amount of daylight affect shedding, independent of temperature effects.",
    "This scenario would allow them to isolate the effect of photoperiod since the temperature does not change, thus removing it as a variable influencing the shedding process.",
    "In contrast, a constant photoperiod or varying temperatures alone would not provide clear insights into the relationship between photoperiod and shedding."
