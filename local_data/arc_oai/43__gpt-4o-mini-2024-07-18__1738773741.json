  "steps": [
    "The gravitational force exerted by an object is fundamentally related to its mass, as defined by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the force of gravity is proportional to the product of the masses of two objects.",
    "While weight is related to gravitational force, it is essentially the force experienced by an object due to gravity acting on its mass, rather than a factor itself.",
    "Volume and size do not directly affect the gravitational force; rather, they can influence mass depending on the density of the material."
