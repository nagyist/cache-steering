  "query": "Question: Which of these reduces the need for people to use nonrenewable resources?\n\nChoices:\nA: recycling paper products\nB: watering the lawn once a week\nC: designing cars that are fuel efficient\nD: using coal to generate electricity",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks what reduces the need for nonrenewable resources, which are resources like coal, oil, and natural gas that can be depleted.",
    "Looking at the options, A (recycling paper products) reduces the need for cutting down trees and manufacturing new paper, which can help preserve forests, but it does not directly prevent the use of nonrenewable resources.",
    "B (watering the lawn once a week) does not relate to nonrenewable resources; it is more about water conservation.",
    "C (designing cars that are fuel efficient) directly reduces the demand for gasoline, which is a nonrenewable resource. By using less fuel, the overall reliance on petroleum is diminished.",
    "D (using coal to generate electricity) increases the use of a nonrenewable resource, which contradicts the goal of reducing reliance on such resources.",
    "After analyzing all options, option C is the most effective in reducing the need for nonrenewable resources."
