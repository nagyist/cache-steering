  "query": "Question: In a food pyramid, which best explains why the number of organisms decreases from one trophic level to the next?\n\nChoices:\nA: Consumers at the lower level require more energy than the top-level consumers.\nB: Consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers.\nC: The consumers are feeding on larger organisms that have less energy.\nD: The consumers are feeding on smaller organisms that have less energy.",
  "steps": [
    "The food pyramid represents the flow of energy from one trophic level to the next.",
    "Energy is lost at each trophic level, primarily through heat and life processes.",
    "Thus, there is less energy available to support organisms at higher trophic levels.",
    "Organisms at higher levels need more energy to sustain themselves because of inefficiencies in energy transfer.",
    "This means that fewer organisms can be sustained at each successive level up the pyramid.",
    "Choice B states that consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers, aligning with the need for more energy at higher trophic levels due to energy loss along the chain."

  "solution": "B"
