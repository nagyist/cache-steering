  "query": "Question: Students are designing kites to discover what type of kite flies the highest. Which is the most important to consider when designing a kite to fly high?\n\nChoices:\nA: string length\nB: surface area\nC: materials used\nD: time of day",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider what factors influence a kite's ability to achieve high altitude. The materials used can affect the structural integrity and weight of the kite, which could impact how well it flies.",
    "Next, surface area plays a role in lift generation; kites with larger surface areas can catch more wind, potentially allowing them to fly higher. However, too much surface area can also lead to increased drag.",
    "String length is important, but it primarily determines how far you can let the kite out rather than its ability to fly high. In contrast, certain materials might be more or less effective in certain wind conditions but are not as critical as the kite's overall design.",
    "Finally, the time of day does not directly affect the design of the kite. Factors like thermal updrafts can vary with the time of day, but they do not influence the kite's design itself."
