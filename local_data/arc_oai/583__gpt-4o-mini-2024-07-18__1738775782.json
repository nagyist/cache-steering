    "A single-cell organism performs all essential functions of life, including metabolism, energy consumption, and reproduction.",
    "However, it cannot specialize in functions as cells in multicellular organisms do (e.g., muscle cells, nerve cells, etc.).",
    "Specialization occurs in multicellular organisms when different types of cells take on specific functions, which a single-cell organism cannot do as it operates as a whole."
