  "query": "Question: Which is a chemical change?\n\nChoices:\nA: Element 1 is hammered into a thin sheet.\nB: Element 2 is heated and turns into a liquid.\nC: Element 3 turns a greenish color as it sits in air.\nD: Element 4 is ground up into a fine, slippery powder.",
  "steps": [
    "A chemical change involves a transformation that alters the chemical composition of a substance, while a physical change does not.",
    "Option A describes a physical change (hammering) as it does not change the chemical nature of the element.",
    "Option B describes a physical change since heating a solid to a liquid state does not change its chemical structure.",
    "Option C indicates that Element 3 changes color when exposed to air, suggesting a possible chemical reaction with oxygen or moisture, which can imply a change in its chemical composition.",
    "Option D describes grinding a substance into a powder, which is also a physical change as the chemical structure remains the same.",
    "Thus, the only option that indicates a potential chemical change is C, where the element is reacting with air and changing color."
