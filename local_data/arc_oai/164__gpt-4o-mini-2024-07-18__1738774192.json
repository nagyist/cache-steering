  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand the characteristics of red stars, which are typically cooler than the Sun. They are often classified as red dwarfs or giants, and their surface temperatures are generally lower.",
    "Next, if red stars have a greater volume, this would not necessarily relate to their classification, as volume can vary widely among different types of stars regardless of their color. Both larger stars and smaller ones could be red.",
    "Looking at the rates of rotation, there isn't a strong correlation indicating that red stars consistently rotate faster than the Sun. Various factors affect rotation rates.",
    "Regarding the number of orbiting planets, this is highly variable and depends on many factors such as the star's formation history and environment rather than its color or temperature. Thus, no assumption can be definitively made that red stars have more planets.",
    "Therefore, considering surface temperature, red stars typically have a lower surface temperature than the Sun, which means they do not have a greater surface temperature."
