  "query": "Question: Which is the best evidence that rocks found deep underground were once exposed at the surface?\n\nChoices:\nA: The rocks have been melted by a magma.\nB: The rocks have been broken by faults.\nC: The rocks have been weathered by water.\nD: The rocks have been folded by pressure.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which evidence indicates that rocks found deep underground were once at the surface, we need to identify processes that would occur at or near the surface.",
    "Option A (melted by magma) suggests that the rocks have been subjected to extreme heat and are not indicative of surface conditions.",
    "Option B (broken by faults) can occur both at surface level and deep underground, but it does not directly imply exposure to surface weathering.",
    "Option C (weathered by water) specifically implies that the rocks have been subjected to surface conditions, as weathering typically occurs at or near the surface where water can interact with the rocks.",
    "Option D (folded by pressure) refers to deformation resulting from tectonic forces that can occur both beneath and above ground, but it does not specifically indicate prior exposure to the surface environment.",
    "Based on the assessment, option C is the most indicative of the rocks being once exposed at the surface due to the weathering process."
