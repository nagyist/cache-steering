  "query": "Question: All of these are examples of the ways Earth and the Moon interact except\n\nChoices:\nA: the phases of the Moon.\nB: the tides on Earth.\nC: seasons on Earth.\nD: lunar eclipses.",
  "steps": [
    "First, identify the ways Earth and the Moon interact. The phases of the Moon are a direct result of the Moon's position relative to the Earth and the Sun.",
    "Second, consider how tides on Earth are influenced by the gravitational pull of the Moon. This is a well-documented interaction.",
    "Next, examine the concept of lunar eclipses. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight from reaching the Moon. This is also an interaction between the two bodies.",
    "Finally, evaluate the seasons on Earth. Seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis as it orbits the Sun, and they are not influenced directly by the Moon."
