  "query": "Question: Scientists know that Earth is constantly changing. They are familiar with the processes that are repeated daily, monthly, and yearly. Which of these is a natural event that can be predicted to occur monthly?\n\nChoices:\nA: volcanic eruptions\nB: earthquake activity\nC: phases of the moon\nD: precipitation amounts",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which natural event can be predicted to occur monthly, I need to analyze each option. Volcanic eruptions (A) and earthquake activity (B) are unpredictable in terms of timing and frequency.",
    "Next, I consider the phases of the moon (C). The moon goes through its phases in a predictable cycle of about 29.5 days, making it a reliable monthly event.",
    "Lastly, precipitation amounts (D) can vary greatly from month to month and are influenced by numerous factors, making them difficult to predict on a consistent monthly schedule."
