  "steps": [
    "The water cycle involves processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection of water. Each of these processes can be directly measured or observed during an investigation of the water cycle.",
    "Among the given options, precipitation amounts are a critical component of the water cycle, as they directly represent the water falling from the atmosphere back to the Earth.",
    "Wind speed, ozone layer, and natural gas emissions do not represent the direct measures of the water cycle processes like precipitation does. Wind speed might influence evaporation but isn't a direct measurement of the cycle itself."
