  "query": "Question: A rabbit population has increased noticeably in the past ten years. Which of the following is a reasonable hypothesis for this population growth?\n\nChoices:\nA: Competition for food has increased among rabbits.\nB: The rabbit's main predator has been eliminated by human development.\nC: Abnormal weather conditions have decreased water levels of the local ponds.\nD: An organism that relies on similar food sources has migrated into the area.",
  "steps": [
    "Consider the factors that influence rabbit population growth. Key contributors include availability of food, predation, habitat changes, and competition with other species.",
    "Evaluate choice A: Increased competition for food would likely decrease the rabbit population rather than increase it, making this hypothesis unreasonable.",
    "Assess choice B: The elimination of the rabbit's main predator would lead to a rise in the rabbit population, as fewer rabbits would be captured and eaten, suggesting this is a plausible explanation for the population growth.",
    "Look at choice C: Abnormal weather conditions that decrease water levels could negatively impact the rabbit population by affecting their habitat and food sources, making this hypothesis less likely.",
    "Analyze choice D: While the migration of a similar organism could potentially lead to increased competition, it could also have negligible effects or even benefit the rabbit population depending on the circumstances. However, it's less directly related than the removal of a predator."
