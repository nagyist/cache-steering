  "query": "Question: Scientists are collecting samples from sediment deposits in Biscayne Bay. Test results show that salinity in the bay is increasing. Which human influence might have led to this environmental change?\n\nChoices:\nA: establishing the bay as a national park in 1980\nB: finding sunken ships resting on the floor of the bay\nC: collecting marine animals from the bottom of the bay\nD: developing power plants along the shoreline of the bay",
  "steps": [
    "The question focuses on identifying a human influence that might lead to increased salinity in Biscayne Bay.",
    "Option A, \"establishing the bay as a national park in 1980,\" would likely protect the environment rather than negatively impact salinity levels.",
    "Option B, \"finding sunken ships resting on the floor of the bay,\" does not have a direct impact on salinity.",
    "Option C, \"collecting marine animals from the bottom of the bay,\" might disturb the ecosystem but doesn't directly explain increasing salinity levels.",
    "Option D, \"developing power plants along the shoreline of the bay,\" can influence salinity levels due to potential water discharge, changes in water flow, or localized habitat alterations caused by industrial activities."

  "solution": "D"
