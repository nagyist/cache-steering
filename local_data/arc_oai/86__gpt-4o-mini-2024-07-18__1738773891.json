  "query": "Question: When a mirror is placed by a fish bowl with a beta fish swimming inside, the beta fish sees what appears to be another fish. This occurs because of\n\nChoices:\nA: absorption.\nB: refraction.\nC: reflection.\nD: diffraction.",
  "steps": [
    "The fish sees another fish in the mirror because the mirror displays an image of itself and the beta fish.",
    "This phenomenon occurs due to light bouncing off the surface of the mirror rather than passing through it.",
    "In optics, the process of light bouncing off a surface is known as reflection."
