  "query": "Question: The respiratory system cannot deliver oxygen to the cells of the body, nor can it remove carbon dioxide, without which two body systems?\n\nChoices:\nA: muscular and nervous\nB: digestive and muscular\nC: cardiovascular and nervous\nD: cardiovascular and muscular",
  "steps": [
    "The respiratory system is responsible for exchanging gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) with the blood.",
    "For oxygen to reach the body's cells and for carbon dioxide to be removed, a transport medium is necessary, which is provided by the cardiovascular system.",
    "The cardiovascular system includes the heart and blood vessels, which circulate blood throughout the body, transporting oxygen from the lungs to cells and carbon dioxide from cells to the lungs.",
    "The muscular system is not directly involved in the transport of gases, but muscles help in the mechanical aspect of breathing.",
    "The nervous system regulates and controls breathing, but it does not transport gases.",
    "Given that the cardiovascular system is essential for transporting both oxygen and carbon dioxide, it must be one of the two systems involved.",
    "Considering the options, the answer must be one that includes the cardiovascular system.",
    "Choice D: cardiovascular and muscular complements this, as muscles are involved in the mechanical process of breathing (e.g., diaphragm movement)."
