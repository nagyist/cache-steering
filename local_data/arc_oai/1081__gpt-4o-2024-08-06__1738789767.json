  "query": "Question: Two populations of reef fish live in biological coexistence with each other. Which sentence best describes their relationship?\n\nChoices:\nA: The species compete with each other.\nB: One species preys on the other.\nC: The species ignore each other.\nD: One species benefits from the other.",
  "steps": [
    "The term \"biological coexistence\" suggests that two populations exist together in a way that is balanced and stable over time.",
    "If the species were competing with each other (choice A), it could lead to one outcompeting the other over time, destabilizing coexistence.",
    "If one species preyed on the other (choice B), it would also likely destabilize coexistence as it could lead to a decrease or elimination of the prey population.",
    "If the species ignore each other (choice C), which is another way of saying they are neutral towards each other, it fits well with the idea of coexistence.",
    "If one species benefits from the other (choice D), it typically implies a symbiotic relationship, which can be a form of coexistence but might not imply balance if the relationship is parasitic."
