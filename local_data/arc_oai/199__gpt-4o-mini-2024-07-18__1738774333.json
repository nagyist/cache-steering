  "query": "Question: Which part of an atom occupies the majority of the volume?\n\nChoices:\nA: nucleus\nB: protons\nC: neutrons\nD: electrons",
  "steps": [
    "The nucleus of an atom is very small compared to the overall size of the atom. It is densely packed with protons and neutrons but occupies a tiny fraction of the atomic volume.",
    "Protons are found in the nucleus, so they do not occupy the majority of the atom's volume either.",
    "Neutrons, like protons, are located within the nucleus and also contribute to the mass of the atom, but they do not take up the majority of the atom's volume.",
    "Electrons are found in the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus and actually occupy most of the volume of the atom due to the space they take up as they move around the nucleus."
