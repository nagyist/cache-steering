  "query": "Question: Salivary amylase is an enzyme in the human body that digests carbohydrates from food. When food mixed with saliva enters the stomach, the action of salivary amylase slows dramatically. Which causes salivary amylase enzyme to stop digesting food?\n\nChoices:\nA: The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.\nB: The concentration of food decreases in the stomach.\nC: The temperature of the food increases in the stomach.\nD: The food is mixed more in the mouth than in the stomach.",
  "steps": [
    "Salivary amylase is designed to work optimally at a specific pH level, which is around neutral (pH 6-7) found in the mouth.",
    "The stomach has a much lower pH, typically around 1.5 to 3.5, due to gastric acids, which can denature enzymes like salivary amylase.",
    "When food enters the stomach and the pH drops, salivary amylase becomes less effective and ultimately stops its activity because it is not suited to function in acidic environments.",
    "Other choices do not directly address the change in pH within the stomach that would affect the enzyme's ability to digest carbohydrates."
