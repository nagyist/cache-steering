  "query": "Question: What is the most likely outcome of the Moon moving away from Earth?\n\nChoices:\nA: A lunar day is shorter.\nB: A lunar eclipse lasts longer.\nC: Earth moves closer to the Sun.\nD: Earth's tides decrease in size.",
  "steps": [
    "The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. This change affects various natural phenomena on Earth, especially tidal forces.",
    "The gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon is responsible for creating tides. As the Moon moves further away, its gravitational influence on the Earth weakens, which would lead to changes in the tidal patterns.",
    "As the gravitational effect of the Moon decreases due to its distance, the size of the tides will also decrease, resulting in smaller high and low tides.",
    "Now, I evaluate the options: A (shorter lunar day) does not relate to the Moon's distance; B (longer lunar eclipse) does not directly correlate with the Moon's distance; C (Earth moves closer to the Sun) isn't a direct consequence of the Moon moving away; D (Earth's tides decrease in size) logically correlates with the Moon's distance increasing, as weaker gravitational pull leads to smaller tides."
