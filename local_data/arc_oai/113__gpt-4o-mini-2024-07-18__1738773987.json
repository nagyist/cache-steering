  "query": "Question: Plants have cells, tissues, organs, and systems that allow them to function as complete organisms. Which parts of a plant function as an organ?\n\nChoices:\nA: leaves\nB: spores\nC: root hairs\nD: chlorophyll molecules",
  "steps": [
    "To determine which parts of a plant function as an organ, we need to understand what constitutes an organ. In plants, organs are structures that have specific functions and are made up of different tissues working together.",
    "Leaves are known to be one of the major organs of plants, as they are involved in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Therefore, leaves can be considered an organ.",
    "Spores are not considered organs; they are reproductive units of plants, such as ferns and fungi. They do not perform the physiological functions characteristic of plant organs.",
    "Root hairs are specialized structures that increase the surface area of roots for water and nutrient absorption, but they are typically considered extensions of root cells rather than a separate organ.",
    "Chlorophyll molecules are pigments that facilitate photosynthesis but are not organs; they are part of the cellular machinery within the leaves."
