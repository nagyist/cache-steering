  "query": "Question: Which substance should a student apply to the skin if he or she gets splashed with an acid?\n\nChoices:\nA: water\nB: vinegar\nC: salt\nD: formaldehyde",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that the student has been splashed with an acid, which can cause skin irritation or burns.",
    "When dealing with acid spills on the skin, the common approach is to neutralize or dilute the acid to avoid further injury.",
    "Water is the most commonly recommended substance for rinsing away acids from the skin, as it helps to dilute the acid and wash it off.",
    "Vinegar, salt, and formaldehyde are not appropriate for neutralizing to an acid. Vinegar is an acid itself (acetic acid), salt is not a neutralizing agent, and formaldehyde is a toxic substance.",
    "Hence, the best option among the choices for neutralizing or diluting the acid is water."
