  "steps": [
    "First, I will analyze the classification criteria for vegetables. Size, color, and shape of plant parts are all objective characteristics that can be used for scientific classification.",
    "Next, I will consider if \"whether they taste good\" can be a scientific classification criterion. Taste is subjective and varies from person to person, making it an unreliable factor for scientific classification.",
    "I will conclude that the only option that does not fit within scientific classification is the subjective nature of taste."
