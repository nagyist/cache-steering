  "query": "Question: A crop of corn plants is genetically modified so that the plants produce a natural pesticide. People are concerned that these corn plants might transfer modified genetic material to other plants. Which of the following is the best way to further modify the plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic materials to other plants?\n\nChoices:\nA: changing the plants so they do not make pollen\nB: changing the plants so they do not harm insects\nC: changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients\nD: changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified",
  "steps": [
    "The concern here is about the transfer of modified genetic material from the genetically modified corn plants to other plants, which commonly occurs through the pollen during the reproduction process.",
    "To prevent this transfer, it would be effective to modify the plants in such a way that they do not produce pollen, as this is the mechanism through which the genetic material would be shared with other plants.",
    "Options B, C, and D do not directly address the issue of pollen production. Option B (not harming insects) does not affect genetic transfer, C (not producing nutrients) impacts the plant's survival and growth, and D (not being easily identifiable) does not prevent genetic transfer."
