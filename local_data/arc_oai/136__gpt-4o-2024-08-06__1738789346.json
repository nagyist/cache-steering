  "query": "Question: What is formed when a neutral atom gains an electron?\n\nChoices:\nA: A mixture\nB: An iron\nC: A molecule\nD: A metal",
  "steps": [
    "A neutral atom consists of an equal number of protons and electrons.",
    "When a neutral atom gains an electron, it will have more electrons than protons.",
    "This extra electron gives it a negative charge, transforming the atom into an ion.",
    "Specifically, an atom that gains an electron becomes a negatively charged ion, also known as an anion."
