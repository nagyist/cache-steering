  "query": "Question: In which layer of the Sun does nuclear fusion occur?\n\nChoices:\nA: core\nB: radiative zone\nC: convection zone\nD: chromosphere",
  "steps": [
    "The Sun is composed of several layers, each with different characteristics and processes.",
    "Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the Sun, where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, releasing energy.",
    "The core of the Sun is the innermost layer, where temperatures and pressures are high enough for nuclear fusion to occur.",
    "The radiative zone surrounds the core and is where energy generated in the core is transported outward by radiation, but fusion does not occur there.",
    "The convection zone surrounds the radiative zone and is where energy is transported by convection, but also does not involve nuclear fusion.",
    "The chromosphere is an outer layer of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, further from the core, and does not participate in nuclear fusion."
