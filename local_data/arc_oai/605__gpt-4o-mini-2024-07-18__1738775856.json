  "query": "Question: A timber company is dividing a 10,000 hectare forest into 5 sections. Which unit is most appropriate to use when showing the area of the divided sections?\n\nChoices:\nA: square inches (in.^2)\nB: square meters (m^2)\nC: square kilometers (km^2)\nD: square centimeters (cm^2)",
  "steps": [
    "The total area of the forest is 10,000 hectares, which is a substantial size. We need to identify a unit that is appropriate for measuring large areas.",
    "1 hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters. Therefore, 10,000 hectares is equal to 10,000 * 10,000 = 100,000,000 square meters.",
    "Square inches and square centimeters are much smaller units typically used for much smaller areas, thus they would not be practical for measuring a forest of this size.",
    "Square kilometers is a larger unit and is often used to measure areas like forests, parks, and regions. One square kilometer is equal to 100 hectares.",
    "Dividing 10,000 hectares into sections would be best represented in square kilometers as this would make the numbers manageable and easier to understand. In this case, 10,000 hectares is equivalent to 100 square kilometers."
