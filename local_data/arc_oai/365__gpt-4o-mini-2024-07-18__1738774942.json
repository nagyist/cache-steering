  "query": "Question: Which of the following best describes a mineral?\n\nChoices:\nA: the main nutrient in all foods\nB: a type of grain found in cereals\nC: a natural substance that makes up rocks\nD: the decomposed plant matter found in soil",
  "steps": [
    "First, I need to determine what a mineral is commonly defined as in geology and chemistry.",
    "A mineral is typically defined as a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure.",
    "Now, I will analyze the provided choices in relation to the definition of a mineral.",
    "Choice A states that a mineral is the main nutrient in all foods, which does not align with the geological definition of a mineral.",
    "Choice B refers to a type of grain found in cereals, which is more related to agriculture and food, not geology.",
    "Choice C states that a mineral is a natural substance that makes up rocks. This is closely aligned with the definition of minerals as they indeed are the components that form rocks.",
    "Choice D describes decomposed plant matter found in soil, which refers to organic material, not minerals.",
    "Considering all the choices, only choice C accurately describes a mineral in the context I established."
