  "query": "Question: Constructive forces build a new mountain range. How will weathering and erosion change the features of the mountain range over time?\n\nChoices:\nA: layering the rocks\nB: crystallizing the rocks\nC: folding the layers of the rocks\nD: rounding the shapes of the rocks",
  "steps": [
    "Constructive forces create new landforms, such as mountain ranges, through processes like tectonic activity.",
    "Weathering and erosion are processes that wear down and reshape these landforms over time.",
    "Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller particles, while erosion removes these particles and transports them to different locations.",
    "Over time, these processes will smooth out and round the jagged shapes of the newly formed mountains, rather than layering, crystallizing, or folding them."

  "solution": "D"
