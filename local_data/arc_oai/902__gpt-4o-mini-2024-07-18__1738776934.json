  "query": "Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?\n\nChoices:\nA: erosion\nB: deposition\nC: compaction\nD: cementation",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about the initial step involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks, which are formed through a series of geological processes.",
    "Sedimentary rocks typically start forming when sediments are produced, which is primarily caused by the breaking down of existing rocks.",
    "This breakdown of rocks is referred to as erosion, where materials are weathered and carried away by natural forces like water, wind, or ice.",
    "The other options, such as deposition, compaction, and cementation, occur later in the sedimentary rock formation process after erosion has taken place."
