  "query": "Question: Changes should be made to a scientific theory when\n\nChoices:\nA: public support of the theory decreases.\nB: the theory is more than 100 years old.\nC: new technology provides updated information.\nD: financial gain can be made by adding data.",
  "steps": [
    "To determine when changes should be made to a scientific theory, we need to consider the basis of scientific progress. Science evolves with new evidence and information rather than solely due to public opinion or the age of a theory.",
    "Option A suggests that changes should occur when public support decreases. However, scientific theories must be based on empirical evidence, not on public opinion. Public support can wane for many reasons, including misconceptions or misinformation.",
    "Option B argues that a theory should be updated simply because it is old. While older theories can be revised, age alone is not a valid reason for change unless new information contradicts it.",
    "Option C states that changes should occur when new technology provides updated information. This is a valid point as advancements in technology often enable scientists to gather new data that could challenge or reinforce existing theories.",
    "Option D implies that financial gain is a reason to change a theory. This is not a scientific reason and undermines the integrity of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.",
    "Considering all options, the best reasoning aligns with Option C, where technology leads to updated and potentially more accurate information that can affect a scientific theory."
