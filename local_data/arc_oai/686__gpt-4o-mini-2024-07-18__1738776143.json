  "query": "Question: When high winds knocked down pine trees in a wooded region, it created a gap in the crowded canopy and allowed sunlight to fall on the ground. The increased sunlight allowed a dense growth of raspberry plants which protected young pine seedlings from being eaten by herbivores. Over time, the pine seedlings grew and blocked sunlight from falling on the woodland floor, thereby preventing growth of more raspberry plants. Which of these terms best describes the process of change observed in this woodlands community?\n\nChoices:\nA: adaptation\nB: cooperation\nC: natural selection\nD: ecological succession",
  "steps": [
    "The scenario describes a change in the woodland community due to environmental changes caused by high winds, which created a gap in the canopy for sunlight to reach the ground.",
    "The growth of raspberry plants due to increased sunlight directly relates to how the community develops over time, as these plants support young pine seedlings by providing protection.",
    "As the pine seedlings mature and block sunlight, they change the conditions of their habitat, reducing the raspberry plants' growth. This indicates a shift in species dominance and the plant community structure.",
    "This process reflects ecological succession, where an ecological community changes over time, often characterized by a sequence of stages leading to a stable state."
