  "query": "Question: A road cut shows a layer of shale on top of a layer of limestone. This indicates\n\nChoices:\nA: the shale layer is older than the limestone layer.\nB: a fault occurred during the deposition of the layers.\nC: the environment changed between the times of deposition.\nD: volcanic activity occurred when these layers were deposited.",
  "steps": [
    "The question describes a sequence of sedimentary rock layers, with shale on top of limestone. This configuration can provide information about the geological history of the area.",
    "In sedimentary layers, the principle of superposition indicates that older layers are typically found below younger layers. Thus, if shale is on top of limestone, the shale layer is younger than the limestone layer.",
    "Given the scenario, we can infer that there was a change in environmental conditions that allowed for the different types of sediment (shale and limestone) to be deposited over time. Therefore, the presence of shale on top of limestone suggests a change in the depositional environment between the two layers.",
    "The other options do not accurately describe the geological situation presented. There is no indication of a fault, nor volcanic activity, and the order of deposition rules out the idea that shale is older than limestone."
