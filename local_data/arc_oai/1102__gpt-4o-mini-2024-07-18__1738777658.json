  "query": "Question: An atom includes 8 electrons, 8 protons, and 8 neutrons. What is the mass of the atom?\n\nChoices:\nA: 8\nB: 16\nC: 24\nD: 32",
  "steps": [
    "The mass of an atom is primarily determined by the sum of the mass of its protons and neutrons, as electrons contribute negligibly to the total mass.",
    "In this case, there are 8 protons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu).",
    "There are also 8 neutrons. The mass of a neutron is also approximately 1 amu.",
    "Thus, the total mass contributed by the protons is 8 amu (from the 8 protons) and the total mass contributed by the neutrons is also 8 amu (from the 8 neutrons).",
    "Now, I will add the contributions: 8 (from protons) + 8 (from neutrons) = 16 amu."
