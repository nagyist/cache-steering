  "query": "Question: In a healthy forest, dead trees and limbs fall to the ground and decompose. Which of these statements best describes why decomposition is important to a forest ecosystem?\n\nChoices:\nA: Nutrients are released when wood is broken down.\nB: Worms produce oxygen used by other organisms.\nC: Dead trees provide nest sites for many different species of birds.\nD: Water is stored in dead trees and limbs.",
  "steps": [
    "Decomposition is the process by which dead organic matter is broken down into simpler organic and inorganic materials.",
    "As dead trees and limbs decompose, they release essential nutrients back into the soil, which supports the growth of other plants and overall ecosystem health.",
    "While worms and other organisms play roles in the ecosystem, the direct release of nutrients from decomposing wood is a primary reason decomposition is important.",
    "The other options, such as nest sites or water storage, may provide benefits, but they do not fundamentally describe the vital ecological role of decomposition."
