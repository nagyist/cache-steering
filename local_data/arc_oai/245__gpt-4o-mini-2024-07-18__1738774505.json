  "query": "Question: You need to move products across the ocean from Boston to Europe. What are your choices?\n\nChoices:\nA: ship or airplane\nB: truck or ship\nC: truck or airplane\nD: tunnel or ship",
  "steps": [
    "The question asks about moving products across the ocean, which suggests that the transportation needs to be able to cover a significant body of water.",
    "Out of the options provided, only shipping methods that can operate across oceans are relevant. Trucks, while useful for land transport, cannot cross the ocean.",
    "Among the options, the combination of ship or airplane (Choice A) includes a valid ocean transport method (ship).",
    "Choice B (truck or ship) is invalid since trucks cannot cross the ocean.",
    "Choice C (truck or airplane) is also invalid because trucks cannot be used for ocean transport.",
    "Choice D (tunnel or ship) is not feasible since there are no tunnels across the ocean.",
    "Thus, the only valid choice for moving products across the ocean is Choice A, which includes both shipping options (ship) and potentially air transport (airplane)."
