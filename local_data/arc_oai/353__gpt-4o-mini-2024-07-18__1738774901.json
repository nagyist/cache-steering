  "query": "Question: A student investigated the percentage of energy obtained from several food sources for a population of eagles. Which format is the best way to display this data?\n\nChoices:\nA: a table\nB: a pie chart\nC: a bar graph\nD: a line graph",
  "steps": [
    "The student is investigating the percentage of energy obtained from different food sources, which involves comparing parts of a whole.",
    "A pie chart is particularly effective for displaying percentages and parts of a whole, making it easier to visualize how each food source contributes to the total energy intake.",
    "While a bar graph could be used for this data, it is better suited for comparing quantities rather than showing percentages of a whole.",
    "A table is useful for organizing data but does not effectively illustrate the proportional relationships visually.",
    "A line graph is not suitable here since it is typically used for showing trends over time rather than comparisons of parts of a whole."
