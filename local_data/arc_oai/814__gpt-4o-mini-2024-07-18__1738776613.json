  "query": "Question: One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. This unit is most often used to describe the distance between which two objects?\n\nChoices:\nA: from galaxy to galaxy\nB: from Saturn to Mercury\nC: from the Sun to Proxima Centauri\nD: from the Big Dipper to the Little Dipper",
  "steps": [
    "The question states that one astronomical unit (AU) is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.",
    "The question is asking which two objects are primarily described using the astronomical unit.",
    "Options A, B, and D involve distances that are much larger or unrelated to the distance typically measured in astronomical units.",
    "Option C mentions the distance from the Sun to Proxima Centauri, which is a distance measured in light years, not AUs.",
    "Despite the misleading information about Proxima Centauri, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is typically used as 1 AU for comparisons within our solar system."
