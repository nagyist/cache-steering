  "query": "Question: Which statement best describes a liquid sample?\n\nChoices:\nA: It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.\nB: It keeps its shape when transferred to a larger container.\nC: Its volume can be greatly reduced by adding pressure.\nD: Its shape can be changed by increasing its temperature.",
  "steps": [
    "The first step is to evaluate the properties of liquids. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container.",
    "The second step is to examine each statement against the properties of liquids. Statement A claims that a liquid will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container, which is true.",
    "The third step is to analyze the remaining statements. Statement B incorrectly suggests that liquids keep their shape in a larger container, which is false since liquids do not have a fixed shape.",
    "The fourth step is to evaluate statement C. This statement suggests that the volume of a liquid can be greatly reduced by adding pressure. However, while liquids can be compressed slightly, they are not greatly compressible under pressure compared to gases.",
    "The fifth step is to consider statement D, which states that increasing temperature changes the shape of a liquid. While heating may affect viscosity and movement, it does not alter the fundamental shape of the liquid in a container.",
    "After evaluating all statements, A is the only correct statement that accurately describes the behavior of liquids."
