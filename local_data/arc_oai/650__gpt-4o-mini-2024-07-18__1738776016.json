  "steps": [
    "The question asks for an organ system in humans that has a similar function to the xylem and phloem in plants, which transport water and nutrients.",
    "The xylem primarily transports water and dissolved minerals, while the phloem transports sugars and other metabolic products.",
    "In humans, the cardiovascular system is responsible for circulating blood, which carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body, similar to the functions of xylem and phloem in plants.",
    "The other options (nervous system, respiratory system, and integumentary system) do not primarily deal with the transportation of substances like nutrients and water, making them less relevant to the question."
