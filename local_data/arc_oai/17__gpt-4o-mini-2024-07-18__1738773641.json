  "query": "Question: One evening as it is getting dark, Alex sits on the front porch and watches the sun slowly disappear behind the neighbor's house across the street. Which explains this observation?\n\nChoices:\nA: The sun's light is reflected by the clouds.\nB: The sun's light is refracted by the atmosphere.\nC: The sun moves from west to east each day.\nD: The sun appears to move due to Earth's rotation.",
  "steps": [
    "First, consider the context of the observation. Alex is watching the sunset, which is the sun disappearing from view behind an obstruction (the neighbor's house) as the day turns into night.",
    "Next, evaluate the choices. Option A talks about reflection in the clouds, which does not directly explain the sun disappearing behind the house since the clouds do not block the sun in this scenario.",
    "Option B mentions refraction by the atmosphere. While atmospheric refraction can affect the apparent position of the sun, it does not account for the phenomenon of the sun setting behind a structure.",
    "Considering option C, the sun moving from west to east is inaccurate as the sun actually rises in the east and sets in the west, meaning this doesn\u2019t explain Alex\u2019s observation.",
    "Finally, option D states that the sun appears to move due to Earth's rotation. This is correct, as the Earth rotates on its axis, causing the sun to appear to move across the sky, leading to the sunset observed by Alex."
