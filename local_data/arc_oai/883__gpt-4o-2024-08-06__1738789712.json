  "query": "Question: Which of these processes can cause layers of rock to be arranged so that the youngest layers are found below older layers?\n\nChoices:\nA: melting and hardening\nB: cooling and heating\nC: deposition and cementing\nD: uplifting and faulting",
  "steps": [
    "In the geological context, the arrangement of rock layers, where younger layers are typically found above older layers, is due to the process of deposition over time.",
    "Deposition occurs when sediments are laid down in new locations, and over time, these become cemented into sedimentary rock layers.",
    "Melting and hardening processes relate to the formation of igneous rocks through magma or lava, not to sedimentary layering.",
    "Cooling and heating might relate to metamorphic processes but do not specifically reorder sediment layers to place younger below older.",
    "Uplifting and faulting are tectonic processes that can tilt, fold, or break the rock layers, potentially reversing the order or altering the positioning of layers.",
    "Among the choices, uplifting and faulting is the process that can reposition rock layers so that younger layers are underneath older layers."
