  "query": "Question: In one of the steps of the carbon cycle, a person exhales a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Which of the following is most likely to happen next to the atom of carbon in this molecule?\n\nChoices:\nA: It may be used as part of a sugar in a plant.\nB: It may become part of a protein in an animal.\nC: It may be consumed as a fossil fuel is burned.\nD: It may be decomposed into carbon and oxygen by a bacterium.",
  "steps": [
    "A molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) contains a carbon atom that is released into the atmosphere when a person exhales.",
    "This carbon atom can be utilized by plants during photosynthesis, where they convert CO2 from the atmosphere into glucose (a sugar).",
    "The options provided relate to different processes involving carbon, but the immediate path for exhaled CO2 is for plants to take it in for photosynthesis."
