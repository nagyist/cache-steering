  "query": "Question: In a copper wire, a temperature increase is the result of which of the following?\n\nChoices:\nA: an increase in the size of the copper particles\nB: a decrease in the mass of the copper particles\nC: an increase in the motion of the copper particles\nD: a decrease in the distance between the copper particles",
  "steps": [
    "To understand the effect of temperature on copper particles, we first consider that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. An increase in temperature typically results in increased kinetic energy, which manifests as increased motion among particles.",
    "We examine each of the choices provided to see which best correlates with the concept that temperature increase leads to increased motion of particles.",
    "Choice A states there is an increase in the size of the copper particles. However, temperature increase is related to the motion of particles rather than their size. Thus, this choice does not apply.",
    "Choice B suggests that there is a decrease in the mass of the copper particles. Temperature increase does not imply that particles lose mass but rather suggests higher energy and motion without changing mass. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.",
    "Choice C claims there is an increase in the motion of the copper particles. This aligns well with the definition of temperature increases as they relate to the kinetic energy and motion of particles, making this choice likely true.",
    "Finally, choice D implies a decrease in the distance between the copper particles. While particles can move closer together when heated, the fundamental result of temperature increase is more closely tied to increased motion rather than distance between particles. Thus, this choice does not address the primary relationship."
