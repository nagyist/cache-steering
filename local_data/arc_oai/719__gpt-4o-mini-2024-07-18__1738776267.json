  "query": "Question: Using fossil fuels wisely and avoiding waste is an example of\n\nChoices:\nA: rationing.\nB: recycling.\nC: substitution.\nD: conservation.",
  "steps": [
    "First, we need to understand what the question is asking: it is looking for a term that describes using fossil fuels wisely and avoiding waste.",
    "Next, we can evaluate the answer choices. \"Rationing\" typically refers to limiting the amount of a resource that can be used, which does not necessarily imply efficient use or avoidance of waste.",
    "Then, \"recycling\" involves processing materials to make them reusable, but it is not directly related to fossil fuels or the concept of avoiding waste in their usage.",
    "\"Substitution\" refers to replacing one resource with another, which does not apply to the wise use and avoidance of waste of existing fossil fuels.",
    "Finally, \"conservation\" refers to the careful management and protection of resources, aligning closely with the idea of using fossil fuels wisely and avoiding waste."
