  "query": "Question: Suppose a new fuel for cars is derived from coal. Cars can go twice as far on a tankful of the new fuel as they can on the same amount of gasoline. How would you categorize the new fuel?\n\nChoices:\nA: It is a renewable fossil fuel.\nB: It is a nonrenewable fossil fuel.\nC: It is a renewable biomass fuel.\nD: It is a nonrenewable biomass fuel.",
  "steps": [
    "The new fuel is derived from coal, which is a fossil fuel.",
    "Fossil fuels, including coal, are generally considered nonrenewable resources because they take millions of years to form and cannot be replenished within a human timescale.",
    "Since the question specifies that the new fuel allows cars to travel twice as far on a tankful compared to gasoline, we need to determine if it alters the categorization of the coal-derived fuel. However, regardless of the efficiency, the origin remains coal, which maintains its status as a fossil fuel.",
    "The options also categorize the fuel based on whether it is renewable or nonrenewable and by its source (fossil vs. biomass). Since coal is not a renewable resource, I can eliminate answers A and C.",
    "Now comparing the remaining options: since the fuel is derived from coal, it can only be classified as a nonrenewable fossil fuel. Therefore, the correct option must be B."
