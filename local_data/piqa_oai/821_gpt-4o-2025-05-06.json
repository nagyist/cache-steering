    "question": "Clean scale of the inside of a tea kettle.\n\nChoices:\nA: Place a mixture of 50 percent vinegar and 50 percent water into the kettle. Switch it on and let it boil.  Cool, the remove the mixture.  Give the inside a wipe with a cloth, rinse and done.\nB: Place a mixture of 90 percent water and 10 percent alcohol into the kettle. Switch it on and let it boil.  Cool, the remove the mixture.  Give the inside a wipe with a cloth, rinse and done.",
    "steps": [
        "Scale inside a tea kettle is typically made up of mineral deposits, primarily calcium. To effectively remove these deposits, one needs to use a solution that can dissolve the minerals.",
        "Vinegar, which contains acetic acid, is a commonly recommended solution for dissolving mineral deposits as the acid reacts with the minerals and breaks them down.",
        "Alcohol is not typically used for removing scale as it is less effective in reacting with and dissolving mineral deposits compared to vinegar.",
        "The method described in choice A involves boiling a mixture of 50 percent vinegar and 50 percent water which ensures enough acetic acid is present to effectively dissolve the scales.",
        "After boiling, allowing the solution to cool ensures that the mineral deposit has had enough time to react with the acid. Wiping and rinsing would then remove the dissolved minerals.",
        "The provided reasoning makes it clear that choice A is the correct method for cleaning the scale inside a tea kettle."
