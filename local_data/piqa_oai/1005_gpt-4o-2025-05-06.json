    "question": "flour\n\nChoices:\nA: could be placed inside a  hand \nB: could be placed inside a  ladle ",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the properties of flour. Flour is a fine, powdery substance that can be easily poured and scooped.",
        "Next, think about the characteristics of a hand and a ladle. A hand has fingers that can hold and grasp objects but is not designed to contain or carry fine powders effectively.",
        "In contrast, a ladle is a utensil with a bowl-shaped end that is specifically designed to scoop and hold liquids or fine substances like flour.",
        "Since a ladle can hold and contain flour more effectively than a human hand, the correct answer is that flour could be placed inside a ladle.",
        "Therefore, the best choice for where flour could be placed is B: could be placed inside a ladle."

    "solution": "B"
