    "question": "fingers\n\nChoices:\nA: can be hit on  a feather to make music\nB: can be hit on  someone's flesh to make music",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the physical properties of a feather. It is light and soft, so when fingers hit a feather, it will not produce a distinct sound or music.",
        "Next, consider the physical properties of human flesh. Flesh is denser than a feather and can produce a variety of sounds when hit, such as claps, slaps, or taps.",
        "Musicians and performers often use their fingers to hit various parts of their body (such as their chest or thighs) to create rhythmic sounds that contribute to musical performances.",
        "Based on these observations, fingers are more likely to produce musical sounds when hitting someone's flesh rather than a feather.",
        "Hence, the correct option is B: can be hit on someone's flesh to make music."

    "solution": "B"
