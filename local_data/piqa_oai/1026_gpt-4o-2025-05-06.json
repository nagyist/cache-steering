        "To determine the correct method for placing magnets on a license plate frame, we need to compare the given choices A and B.",
        "Both options suggest placing two magnets on each edge of the plate and making sure there is enough space between each magnet.",
        "Both options also suggest placing two more magnets on each side in the middle with space in between them.",
        "In terms of adhesive, choice A specifies using epoxy on the back of each magnet, while choice B specifies using glue.",
        "Epoxy is generally stronger and more durable than regular glue, which makes it more suitable for securely attaching magnets to a license plate frame.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, as using epoxy ensures the magnets are firmly attached and less likely to come off."
