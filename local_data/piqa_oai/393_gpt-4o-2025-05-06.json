    "steps": [
        "First, consider the practicality of the two choices.",
        "It is impractical to lay wood on the ceiling and carry out any sort of work on it due to the difficulty of access and stability.",
        "You typically conduct sanding in a position where the wood is securely placed to ensure even application and control.",
        "Placing wood on a surface, such as a table or a workbench, provides a stable working environment.",
        "Sanding involves rubbing sandpaper back and forth on the wood to smoothen or clean it. Moving the sandpaper in a controlled manner across a flat, stable surface allows for better results.",

        "The final assessment based on practicality and typical procedures confirms that choice A is correct."
