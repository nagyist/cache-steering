    "question": "Retreive a stuck item from a vending machine.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a metal coathanger fashioned into an elongated rod to poke it the item through the vending machine's door, until the item falls to a point where it can be easily retrieved.\nB: Use a metal coathanger fashioned into an elongated rod to poke it the item through the vending machine's change slot, until the item falls to a point where it can be easily retrieved.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the structure of a vending machine. Typically, a vending machine has a clear dispensing door at the bottom where items fall for retrieval after purchase.",
        "The change slot, on the other hand, is designed to dispense coins and is usually much narrower and less accessible for retrieving items that are stuck inside the machine.",
        "Using a metal coathanger fashioned into an elongated rod is suggested to help retrieve the stuck item.",
        "Poking the item through the vending machine's door (choice A) makes sense because that is where the item is supposed to dispense and is designed to allow access to the items.",
        "Poking the item through the vending machine's change slot (choice B) is impractical since the change slot is not meant for items retrieval and is very narrow, making this approach ineffective.",
        "Choice A is the correct answer since it utilizes the designated part of the machine meant for dispensing items, thereby making the retrieval more feasible."
