    "question": "To make an easy safe space for a baby to crawl in,\n\nChoices:\nA: make a barrier of pillows and do not let them pass.\nB: inflate a pool indoors to contain the child in it.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we consider the safety and containment needs of a baby who is crawling. A safe space for a baby should be soft, secure, and free of hazards.",
        "Option A suggests making a barrier of pillows and not letting the baby pass. While pillows are soft, they can easily be knocked over, creating gaps through which the baby might escape. This setup is not very secure and could pose a risk if the baby manages to topple or climb over the pillows.",
        "Option B suggests inflating a pool indoors to contain the child. An inflatable pool has higher, more structured sides compared to pillows, making it more effective at containing the baby. The soft, inflatable material also provides a safe environment for the baby to crawl in without the risk of hard surfaces or corners. The likelihood of the baby escaping or encountering a hazard is significantly reduced.",
        "Given the comparison, option B provides a more secure and enclosed space for a baby to crawl safely, fulfilling the basic requirements of an easy and effective solution.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: inflate a pool indoors to contain the child in it."
