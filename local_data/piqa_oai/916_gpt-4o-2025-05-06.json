    "question": "To make pasta easier to eat for kids?\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut it into smaller pieces with a knife and fork, so kids can get more noodles at once.\nB: Cut it into smaller pieces with a knife and fork, so kids can get fewer noodles at once.",
    "steps": [
        "Eating pasta, especially long strands or larger pieces, can be difficult for kids who are not yet adept at using utensils effectively or who have smaller mouths.",
        "Cutting the pasta into smaller pieces allows kids to manage the food better without needing to twirl long strands around a fork or take big bites. This can make the eating process more manageable and less messy.",
        "When pasta is cut into smaller pieces, it is easier for kids to pick up a manageable amount of food at one time.",
        "Option B specifies cutting the pasta into smaller pieces so that kids can get fewer noodles at once. This aligns with the goal of making the food easier to eat, considering the smaller bite sizes would be more appropriate for kids.",
        "Option A suggests cutting pasta into smaller pieces so kids can get more noodles at once, which contradicts the principle of making bite-sized portions for easier eating.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: Cut it into smaller pieces with a knife and fork, so kids can get fewer noodles at once."
