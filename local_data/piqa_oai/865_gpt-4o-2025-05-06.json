    "question": "Store markers and pens.\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut pieces of cardboard box.\nB: Cut pieces of cardboard tube.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the best way to store markers and pens, consider the shape and function of the available choices.",
        "Markers and pens are cylindrical and long, so they need a storage solution that can hold them securely and keep them organized without rolling away.",
        "Option A: Cut pieces of cardboard box - while a cardboard box could be used, it typically has a rectangular shape and does not naturally hold cylindrical objects securely unless additional divisions or compartments are added.",
        "Option B: Cut pieces of cardboard tube - this option provides a cylindrical shape that is naturally suited for holding cylindrical objects like markers and pens.",
        "Since the primary objective is to keep the markers and pens organized and secure, the cylindrical shape of the cardboard tube makes it the most suitable choice.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Cut pieces of cardboard tube."
