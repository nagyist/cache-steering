    "question": "How can I unscrew a screw without a screwdriver?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a wooden toothpick for larger screws.\nB: Use a butter knife for larger screws.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the physical characteristics and typical use of a wooden toothpick. It is generally small, thin, and fragile.",
        "Compare these characteristics with the requirements needed to unscrew a larger screw, which typically requires a sturdy and flat object that can fit into the groove of the screw.",
        "Assess the butter knife option. Butter knives have a flat, wide blade that can provide the needed leverage and size to unscrew a larger screw.",
        "Consider practical use and common alternative tools that can substitute for a screwdriver.",
        "Conclude that, given the characteristics and leverage required, a butter knife is a more suitable tool than a wooden toothpick for unscrewing larger screws."
