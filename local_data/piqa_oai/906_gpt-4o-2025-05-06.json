    "question": "How to remove the seeds from a watermelon completely?\n\nChoices:\nA: Slice the watermelon in half, slice the half into further halves and with a spoon pull out each individual seed\nB: Slice the watermelon in half, slice off the ends and with a spoon roll out the seeds from the middle of the watermelon",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the steps outlined in option A.",
        "Option A suggests slicing the watermelon in half and then further halving it, followed by individually pulling out each seed with a spoon.",
        "This method is time-consuming and tedious as watermelon seeds are numerous and it would take a long time to remove each one individually.",
        "Now, let's analyze option B.",
        "Option B involves slicing the watermelon in half and then slicing off the ends.",
        "The key part is using a spoon to roll out the seeds from the center. Since many of the seeds are centrally located in the watermelon, rolling them out from the middle with a spoon would be more efficient than picking each one out.",
        "Thus, option B would be quicker and more effective in removing the seeds completely compared to option A.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Slice the watermelon in half, slice off the ends and with a spoon roll out the seeds from the middle of the watermelon."
