    "question": "To hide device wires in homemade nightstand.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a funnel to hold up the table and run the wires down through it.\nB: Use a pipe to hold up the table and run the wires down through it.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the structure and usage of a funnel. Typically, a funnel is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. This shape is not ideal for holding up a table since it does not provide a stable base.",
        "Now, consider the structure and usage of a pipe. Pipes are cylindrically shaped with consistent width, making them stable for supporting weight. Additionally, they have a hollow interior ideal for running wires through.",
        "The goal is to hide the wires effectively. A pipe offers a straight passage, ensuring wires are neatly concealed and can pass through without tangling.",
        "Based on these considerations, using a pipe to hold up the table and run the wires down through it (B) is the more suitable choice."
