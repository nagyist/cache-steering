    "question": "How can I easily view the items in my refrigerator without taking anything out (even the ones at the back)?\n\nChoices:\nA: Place a plastic type lazy susan on each shelf and place items on them, then you can just turn to see what''s there.\nB: Place a plastic type lazy susan on each  small door mounted shelf and place items on them, then you can just turn to see what''s there.",
    "steps": [
        "There is a need to view items in the refrigerator easily without taking anything out.",
        "One method proposed is to use plastic type lazy susans.",
        "Option A suggests placing lazy susans on each shelf, while option B suggests placing them on small door mounted shelves.",
        "The items at the back of the refrigerator are typically located on the main shelves rather than in the door.",
        "By placing lazy susans on each shelf, you can rotate them to bring items at the back to the front view easily.",
        "Therefore, option A allows for easy viewing of all items on the main shelves, including those at the back, without taking anything out.",
        "Option B does not address viewing the items on the main shelves and thus is less effective in solving the problem.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: Place a plastic type lazy susan on each shelf and place items on them, then you can just turn to see what''s there."
