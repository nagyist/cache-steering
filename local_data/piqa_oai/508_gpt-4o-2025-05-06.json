        "To use a wine opener correctly, it's important to insert the corkscrew into the cork initially. Both options A and B start with the correct step: Push the tip of the corkscrew into the cork.",
        "Next, twisting the corkscrew until it is about three-quarters of the way into the cork ensures that it is securely inserted and less likely to break. Both options include the correct instruction: Twist until the corkscrew is about three-quarters of the way into the cork.",
        "Following this step, the use of the hinge mechanism on the wine opener is essential. The correct method involves pulling up using the hinge as leverage; it provides the necessary force to begin removing the cork without breaking it. In option B: Engage the base hinge with the lip of the bottle and pull upward gently. Option A incorrectly instructs one to push downward, which would not facilitate cork removal properly.",
        "Lastly, completing the cork removal involves using the second hinge if needed. Both options end correctly: When you can't pull anymore, engage the second hinge with the lip of the bottle.",
        "Thus, considering all steps, the correct answer is B: Push the tip of the corkscrew into the cork. Twist until the corkscrew is about three-quarters of the way into the cork. Engage the base hinge with the lip of the bottle and pull upward gently. When you can't pull anymore, engage the second hinge with the lip of the bottle."
