    "question": "Provide a self-contained description.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use your inspiration and provide a self-description.\nB: Read a book on mathmatics then provide a self-contained description.",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the meaning of \"self-contained description.\" A self-contained description means providing all necessary information within the description without needing external references.",
        "Next, evaluate the choices given:\n- Choice A: Use your inspiration and provide a self-description.\n- Choice B: Read a book on mathematics then provide a self-contained description.",
        "Consider that the task is to create a description that includes all the necessary information within itself. Therefore, inspiration and personal insight are more relevant and likely to lead to a complete self-contained description.",
        "On the other hand, reading a book on mathematics might not directly help in providing a self-contained description, as it pertains to the specific field of mathematics and may not inspire personal or self-description.",
        "Thus, the option to use your inspiration and provide a self-description aligns better with the requirement for creating a self-contained description.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Use your inspiration and provide a self-description."
