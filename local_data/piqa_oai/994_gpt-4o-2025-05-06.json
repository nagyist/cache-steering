    "steps": [
        "To cut leather to size, it is essential to first outline the shape you need.",
        "Using a pencil is advisable because it leaves marks that are visible but can be easily erased or cleaned off after the cutting is done.",
        "A pen, however, often leaves permanent marks that can ruin the aesthetic of the leather holster.",
        "For cutting leather, a boxcutter is a good tool as it provides a clean and precise cut, and is effective in cutting through thick materials.",
        "A knife can also be used but it typically requires more skill to ensure precise cuts and it may not be as effective on thicker leather compared to a boxcutter.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Use a pencil to outline the marking for the cut and cut with a boxcutter."
