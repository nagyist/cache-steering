    "question": "To etch a design into a glass jar\n\nChoices:\nA: Using a clean jar place your stencil sticky side down on the jar. Use tape to cover up the spots you don't want to be etched around the stencil. Brush face cream onto the surface of the jar around the stencil and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes. Wash off.\nB: Using a clean jar place your stencil sticky side down on the jar. Use tape to cover up the spots you don't want to be etched around the stencil.

        "First, let\u2019s detail the purpose of etching a design into a glass jar. Etching designs onto glass involves creating a permanent mark or pattern on the surface of the jar.",
        "The first step for both choices involves cleaning the jar and placing a stencil on the jar. This part is correct for both instructions provided.",
        "Using tape to cover spots not meant to be etched is also a standard procedure to ensure that only the desired areas are affected. Again, both options mention this, so they are acceptable in this regard.",
        "The critical part of the etching process involves the application of a substance that will create the etched design. The substance must be able to chemically or mechanically alter the glass surface to produce a permanent pattern.",
        "Choice A suggests using face cream for this process. Face cream is a skincare product and does not have properties that allow it to etch glass. Therefore, it cannot effectively alter the surface of the glass to create a permanent design.",
        "Choice B suggests using etching cream, which is specifically formulated to etch glass surfaces. Etching cream contains chemicals that react with the glass to permanently alter its surface.",
        "Leaving the etching cream on the glass for 3 to 5 minutes is standard practice for achieving a properly etched design. Washing off the cream afterward completes the process to reveal the etched design.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B because it involves using etching cream, which is the appropriate substance for creating an etched design on glass."
