    "steps": [
        "First, let's understand what tweezers are. Tweezers are a small tool used for picking up objects too small to be easily handled with the human fingers.",
        "Tweezers are commonly used in various tasks such as plucking hairs, picking up small items, and in scientific labs for manipulating small objects.",
        "Among the given choices, \"collect trees from outside\" does not make sense because trees are too large to be collected using tweezers.",
        "Therefore, the only logical choice that aligns with the typical use of tweezers is \"collect insects from outside,\" as insects are small and can be picked up with tweezers.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: collect insects from outside."
