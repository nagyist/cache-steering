        "First, identify the common procedure for opening a box of kleenex.",
        "Typically, kleenex boxes are designed with a perforated section on the top for easy access to tissues.",
        "Considering the structure of the box, the most straightforward way to open it would be removing or peeling back the top flap where the hole is.",

        "Choice A suggests turning the box on its side and manipulating the glued flap, which involves more steps and doesn't specifically mention the perforated section designed for easy access.",
        "Choice B describes holding the box with one hand, sticking a finger under the top flap where the hole is, peeling it back, and discarding it. This matches the intended design for accessing tissues efficiently.",
