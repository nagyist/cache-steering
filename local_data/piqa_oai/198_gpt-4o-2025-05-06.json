    "question": "How to more easily fold thick pieces of leather.\n\nChoices:\nA: Score the front side of the leather piece.\nB: Score the back side of the leather piece.",
    "steps": [
        "Thick pieces of leather can be difficult to fold because of their rigidity and the density of the material.",
        "Scoring the back side of the leather weakens the material along that line, allowing it to bend more easily without breaking or cracking the surface.",
        "By scoring the back side, you create a groove or indent that acts as a hinge, facilitating easier folding.",
        "Scoring the front side of the leather would not be as effective because it could mar the appearance and potentially damage the visible surface.",
        "Therefore, the most practical approach is to score the back side of the leather piece to make it easier to fold.",
        "Given the choice between two options, the answer is B: Score the back side of the leather piece."
