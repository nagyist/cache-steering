        "The question asks whether a credit card can measure gaps or distances between rafters.",
        "Consider the size and shape of a credit card: it is a small, rectangular object.",
        "The choice \"can measure gaps between rafters\" implies that it can be used as a simple gauge to check small gaps or spaces.",
        "The choice \"can measure distance between rafters\" implies measuring larger distances, which would likely need a more substantial measuring tool like a tape measure.",
        "Given the small size of a credit card, it is better suited to measure small gaps rather than larger distances.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: can measure gaps between rafters."

    "solution": "A"
