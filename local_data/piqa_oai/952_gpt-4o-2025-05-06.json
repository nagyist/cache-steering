    "question": "how do you make a batch of something?\n\nChoices:\nA: make more than three.\nB: make a tiny bit.",
    "steps": [
        "We need to determine what \"batch\" typically means in the context of making something. A batch generally refers to a group of items produced or prepared at one time.",
        "If a batch refers to a group, it implies making multiple items as opposed to just a few.",
        "Option A mentions making more than three, which fits the idea of a batch being a sizeable number of items.",
        "Option B mentions making a tiny bit, which suggests a very small quantity and does not fit the general definition of a batch.",
        "Hence, the answer that aligns with the definition of a batch is Option A: make more than three."
