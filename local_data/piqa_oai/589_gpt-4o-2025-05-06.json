    "steps": [
        "To address the question of removing a snag from a rug, the first step is to understand what a snag is. A snag refers to loose threads or fibers protruding from the rug.",
        "A practical approach to resolving a snag involves cutting the frayed or loose threads to prevent further unraveling. So the first step is to cut the fray with scissors.",
        "After cutting, using an adhesive is important to ensure that the cut threads do not unravel. Comparing fabric glue and super glue, fabric glue is specifically formulated for use on textiles and fabrics, providing a flexible and durable hold.",
        "Super glue, on the other hand, is a strong adhesive but is not designed for fabrics, and its stiff bond can damage the rug material.",
        "Therefore, to effectively and safely remove the snag from the rug, cutting the fray with scissors and then applying fabric glue is the best choice.",
        "The correct answer is: A: Cut fray with scissors, then apply fabric glue."
