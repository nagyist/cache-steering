    "steps": [
        "Frying croquettes involves using oil to cook them until they are golden and crisp on the outside. However, if they are left in the pan with oil after cooking, they can end up absorbing excess oil, resulting in a mushy texture.",
        "Cooling racks are designed to allow air to circulate around the food, preventing steam from making the food soggy as it cools. This is helpful in maintaining the crispy texture of the croquettes.",
        "Therefore, to prevent croquettes from becoming mushy, they should be removed from the oil after frying and placed on a cooling rack to rest and drain excess oil, thus maintaining their crispiness.",
        "Given these considerations, the correct choice is B: When frying the croquette use only a small amount of cooking oil, once they've been cooked remove from the pan and allow to rest on a cooling rack."
