    "question": "Short term, how can I fix a tear in a tent?\n\nChoices:\nA: Take a piece of duct tape and put it to the outside where it is ripped.\nB: Take a piece of fabric and put it to the outside where it is ripped.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the materials given in the choices for fixing the tear in the tent: duct tape and a piece of fabric.",
        "Next, evaluate the properties of each material: duct tape is adhesive and can stick to surfaces easily, providing an immediate and temporary fix. A piece of fabric, however, is not inherently adhesive and would not stay in place without additional tools like sewing or glue.",
        "Since the question is about a short-term fix, the option that provides immediate adhesion and quick application with minimal tools would be most effective.",
        "Duct tape, being adhesive, can create a quick patch that will hold the tent fabric together and prevent further tearing temporarily.",
        "Therefore, the best short-term solution to fix a tear in a tent would be to use duct tape.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Take a piece of duct tape and put it to the outside where it is ripped."
