    "steps": [
        "To determine how to fix a running toilet, you need to first address the part of the toilet that might be causing the issue: the flapper.",
        "The flapper is a component inside the toilet tank that controls the flushing mechanism. If there are any issues with the flapper, the toilet may continuously run.",
        "Prior to checking the flapper, it's essential to make sure the tank is empty so you can properly examine the flapper without water interfering. This involves draining the water from the tank.",
        "To drain the water from the tank, you first need to stop more water from entering the tank. This can be done by turning off the water supply to the toilet.",
        "After turning off the water supply, flushing the toilet will empty the tank of any water that was already inside it.",
        "Choice B correctly describes the steps for turning off the water to the toilet and flushing to drain excess water.",
        "Choice A suggests turning off the pump and filling the toilet to drain excess water, which does not logically relate to draining the tank efficiently. Therefore, choice A is not correct.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: \"Before you can check the flapper for problems, turn off the water to the toilet. Flush the toilet to drain excess water from the tank.\""
