    "question": "How do you get the water temperature right to take a shower?\n\nChoices:\nA: Turn on the water and let it run until it is warm, check the position of the shower head to make sure it is spraying down and not out of the shower, test the water with your wrist rather then you fingers and determine if the water is comfortable before you get in.\nB: Turn on the water and let it run until it is warm, check the position of the shower head to make sure it is spraying down and not out of the shower, test the water with your head rather then you fingers and determine if the water is comfortable before you get in.",
    "steps": [
        "First, examine the similarities in both choices:\n- Turning on the water and letting it run until it is warm.\n- Checking the position of the shower head to ensure it is spraying down and not out of the shower.\n- Testing the water and determining if the water is comfortable before getting in.",
        "Then, evaluate the differences between the choices:\n- Choice A suggests testing the water with your wrist rather than your fingers.\n- Choice B suggests testing the water with your head rather than your fingers.",
        "Consider practical and safe testing methods for water temperature:\n- The wrist is typically more sensitive to temperature than fingers, providing a more accurate measure.\n- Testing with the head is less common and might not be practical or comfortable, especially in a shower setting.",
        "Therefore, based on common practices and the sensitivity of body parts for testing water temperature, choice A is more logical and practical."
