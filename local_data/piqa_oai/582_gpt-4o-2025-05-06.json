    "question": "how do you clean chalk outside?\n\nChoices:\nA: use a firehose to wet where the chalk is, and it will dissolve.\nB: mop the chalk.",
    "steps": [
        "Begin by considering the nature of chalk. Chalk is a powdery substance that can dissolve and wash away when exposed to water.",
        "When cleaning chalk outside, doing so efficiently requires a method that covers a large area quickly and applies substantial water pressure.",
        "A fire hose is designed to deliver large volumes of water at high pressure, making it capable of quickly wetting and dissolving chalk.",
        "On the other hand, using a mop is impractical for cleaning large outdoor areas as it would take much longer and be less effective.",
        "Therefore, using a fire hose to wet where the chalk is will dissolve and wash away the chalk more effectively."
