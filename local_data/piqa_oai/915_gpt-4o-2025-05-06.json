    "question": "What is a good cheap way to wrap a bare metal knife handle.\n\nChoices:\nA: Bailing twine can provide a good comfortable grip for a very low price.\nB: Paracord can provide a good comfortable grip for a very low price.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand what 'cheap' refers to in the context of the question. Ideally, it should be a cost-effective solution.",
        "Second, we need to consider what 'comfort' refers to - the material should provide a comfortable grip when in use and hold up well under frequent handling.",
        "A bailing twine is typically a very rough and thin material. It might not provide a comfortable grip.",
        "Paracord, on the other hand, is a relatively smooth and durable material. It can be wrapped around to provide a solid and comfortable grip, and meets the need for being affordable.",
        "So, combining these points, we determine that paracord is the better option for wrapping a bare metal knife handle because it provides comfort, durability, and is cost-effective.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Paracord can provide a good comfortable grip for a very low price."
