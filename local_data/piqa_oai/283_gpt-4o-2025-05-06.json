    "steps": [
        "To determine what a vise can crack, you need to understand the function and strength of a vise.",
        "A vise is a mechanical device used to hold an object firmly in place. It typically consists of two parallel jaws, one fixed and the other movable, which can be tightened by turning a screw or lever.",
        "The primary use of a vise is for tasks that require precision and strong grip but not necessarily superhuman strength.",
        "Cracking a nut usually requires a strong grip but within a limit that a vise can easily apply.",
        "Cracking a tree, on the other hand, requires a massive amount of force well beyond what a typical vise is capable of applying.",
        "Given the comparison, it is clear that a vise is more suitable for cracking a nut rather than cracking a tree.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: can crack a nut."
