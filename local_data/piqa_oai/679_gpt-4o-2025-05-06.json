    "question": "How do you undo a daisy chain?\n\nChoices:\nA: Unloosen the first end you made by sliding the cord out the loop, and the rest of the loops will undo themselves.\nB: Unloosen the last end you made by sliding the cord out the loop, and the rest of the loops will undo themselves.",
    "steps": [
        "A daisy chain is made by interlocking loops of cord successively.",
        "The process starts with the first loop and consecutively adds loops to create the chain.",
        "To undo the daisy chain, you need to reverse the process.",
        "Start with the last loop you created, since undoing this loop will set free the previous loops.",
        "As each loop is dependent on the previous loop, sliding out the cord from the last loop will sequentially undo the previous loops until the chain is completely undone.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is to unloosen the last end you made by sliding the cord out the loop, and the rest of the loops will undo themselves."

    "solution": "B"
