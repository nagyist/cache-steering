        "First, consider the purpose of a ladder, which is generally used to assist people in reaching heights that are otherwise out of reach.",
        "Next, reflect on the context given in the choices, which is about hanging paintings.",
        "In order to hang paintings, a person needs to reach a certain height on the wall.",
        "Think about the locations where a ladder can be placed to effectively help someone reach that height.",
        "Placing a ladder on the ceiling would not provide a practical or stable position for reaching the wall.",
        "Placing a ladder on the floor, however, gives the person a stable base to climb up and reach the height required to hang paintings.",
        "Therefore, the logical choice is B: can be placed on the floor to help hang paintings."
