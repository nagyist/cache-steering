    "question": "How to adjust the reach on your Sram brake levers\n\nChoices:\nA: Using the knob on the front of the lever simply turn clockwise to increase reach and counterclockwise to decrease reach\nB: Hold the brake lever in the desired final position for about an hour. After this it will have a \"memory\" and be set in position.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine how to adjust the reach on Sram brake levers, first understand how most modern brake levers work.",
        "Modern brake levers, including those from SRAM, generally have an adjustment mechanism to modify the reach according to user preference.",
        "Adjusting the lever's reach typically involves a mechanical action like turning a knob or screw to set the levers closer to or further from the handlebar.",
        "Examining option A, it suggests using a knob present on the front of the lever and turning it clockwise to increase reach or counterclockwise to decrease reach. This aligns with the common design of adjustable reach brake levers.",
        "Considering option B, it suggests holding the brake lever in the desired position for an hour to allow it to have a \"memory\" and set in position. This is not a standard method for adjusting brake levers and lacks practicality and feasibility.",
        "Thus, based on how brake lever adjustment typically works, option A presents a reasonable and practical method, involving a mechanical adjustment through a knob.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Using the knob on the front of the lever, simply turn clockwise to increase reach and counterclockwise to decrease reach."
