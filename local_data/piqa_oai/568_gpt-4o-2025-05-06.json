        "Bitterness in eggplant is caused by compounds called phenols.",
        "Salting helps draw out the moisture where some of these bitter compounds are concentrated.",
        "10 to 15 minutes is usually sufficient time to allow the salt to draw out the moisture and bitter compounds.",
        "Leaving the eggplant salted for 10 to 15 hours would be excessively long and is unnecessary for reducing bitterness.",
