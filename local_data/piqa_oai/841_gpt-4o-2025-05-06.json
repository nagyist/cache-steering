        "To determine how to properly cook pasta, we need to consider the procedure and the time duration involved in the cooking process.",
        "Boiling water is the first step. Both options suggest boiling 4 quarts of water in a large pot.",
        "Salting the water is the next step. Both options mention adding at least a tablespoon of salt to the boiling water.",
        "Then, the pasta is added to the boiling water. Both options include adding pasta to the boiling, salted water.",
        "The crucial difference between the two options lies in the cooking time. Option A suggests boiling the pasta for 10-12 minutes or until al dente, while Option B suggests boiling the pasta for 10-12 hours.",
        "Cooking pasta for 10-12 minutes is the standard recommended time for most pasta to become al dente (firm to the bite).",
