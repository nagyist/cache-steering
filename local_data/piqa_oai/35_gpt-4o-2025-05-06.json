    "steps": [
        "To determine how to crush the petals of a flower effectively, consider the tools provided in the choices.",
        "Choice A suggests using a hammer and nails. A hammer is generally used for driving nails into surfaces or breaking things apart, while nails are primarily used to fasten objects together. These tools are not designed for crushing soft materials like flower petals.",
