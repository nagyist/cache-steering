    "question": "To make water colder than it is when it is poured from the sink,\n\nChoices:\nA: leave the faucet running for long enough that it becomes cold.\nB: put the water in the fridge or add ice to it to chill it down.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the goal of making water colder than its initial temperature when it is poured from the sink.",
        "Option A suggests leaving the faucet running until the water becomes cold. However, the water from the faucet can only be as cold as the source, and it may not be sufficient to reach the desired cold temperature.",
        "Option B suggests putting the water in the fridge or adding ice to it. These methods actively lower the water\u2019s temperature by introducing it to a colder environment or directly adding frozen elements.",
        "To achieve the goal of making water colder, an approach that reduces the water's temperature effectively should be chosen.",
        "Putting water in the fridge or adding ice are both methods that utilize temperature-controlled environments to lower the temperature of the water.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice to make water colder than it is when poured from the sink is B: put the water in the fridge or add ice to it to chill it down."
