    "question": "To increase a person's typing speed,\n\nChoices:\nA: they should perform plenty of finger stretches.\nB: they should practice typing new words quickly.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, first consider the goal, which is to increase typing speed.",
        "Finger stretches (option A) may improve finger flexibility and reduce the chance of strain, but they do not directly improve typing speed.",
        "Practicing typing new words quickly (option B) involves direct engagement with typing, and practicing consistently can lead to improved muscle memory and typing speed.",
        "Therefore, option B is the correct answer as practicing typing new words quickly directly contributes to the goal of increasing a person's typing speed."

    "solution": "B"
