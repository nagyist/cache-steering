    "question": "table\n\nChoices:\nA: can be chopped with a saw  that is broken\nB: can be chopped with a sword that is broken",
    "steps": [
        "A table is typically made of wood or another solid material.",
        "To chop a table, a sharp object such as a saw or a sword is generally used.",
        "If the saw is broken, it would be difficult or impossible to use it effectively for chopping because its blade might be damaged or its mechanism might be faulty.",
        "On the other hand, if the sword is broken, it might still have a sharp edge or portion that can be used to chop the table.",
        "Therefore, even though the sword is broken, it stands a better chance of being able to chop the table than the broken saw.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: can be chopped with a sword that is broken."

    "solution": "B"
