    "steps": [
        "To determine how to peel a banana, consider the basic steps involved in the process.",
        "First, observe how most people commonly peel a banana. Typically, the peeling starts at one end of the fruit, not from both ends simultaneously.",
        "Next, realize that peeling entails removing sections of the skin.",
        "When starting from one end, you can peel back sections until the edible part, the inner flesh, is exposed. Starting from both ends would not be practical and might result in making the process unnecessarily complicated.",
        "Given that the peeling process begins at one end, the correct approach would be to hold one end of the banana and peel back sections of the skin."
