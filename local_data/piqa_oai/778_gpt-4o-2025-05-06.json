    "steps": [
        "Painting any surface typically requires a drying period to ensure the paint adheres correctly and sets properly.",
        "Metal, being non-porous, may take longer for paint to dry than porous surfaces like wood.",
        "The drying time for paint on metal can depend on several factors including type of paint, humidity, temperature, and thickness of the paint layer.",
        "Generally, paint manufacturers recommend a drying time of 24 hours for the paint to fully cure on non-porous surfaces like metal.",
        "Considering the two choices: 2.4 seconds is too short and unrealistic for paint to properly dry. Waiting 24 hours is consistent with standard practices and manufacturer guidelines.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: You should let the paint dry for at least 24 hours on a metal can."
