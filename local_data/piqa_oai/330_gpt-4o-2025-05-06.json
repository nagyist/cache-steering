        "To determine how to adjust a picture hanging on the wall, we need to understand the goal of the adjustment.",
        "Typically, the goal is to ensure the picture is positioned correctly, achieving a level orientation.",
        "When we want a picture to appear level, the top and bottom of the picture should be parallel to the floor.",
        "This means that when the picture is correctly adjusted, it should not be slanted or tilted.",
        "Option A describes the method to achieve this by holding the sides and moving the picture until the top and bottom are parallel to the floor.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Use a couple fingers from each hand to hold the picture at its sides. Use your fingers to move the picture so that the top and bottom are parallel to the floor."
