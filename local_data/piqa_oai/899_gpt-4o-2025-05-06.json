        "First, identify the task, which is to clean wood blinds.",
        "Both choices start with the same initial step: \"Close your blinds so they sit flat against your window.\" Therefore, this step is correct and applies to both choices.",
        "The next action in both choices is to wipe or dust each individual slat from left to right. This step is clear and practical for cleaning each slat of the wood blinds. Thus, this step also applies to both choices.",
        "The crucial difference lies in the final instruction: \n- Choice A states to \"Rotate the blinds and dust the other side.\" \n- Choice B states to \"Rotate the blinds and clear the air from the other side.\"\n\nCleaning wood blinds typically involves removing dust and debris from both sides of each slat. \"Clear the air from the other side\" is an ambiguous and unclear instruction for cleaning, as it does not directly address dust on the slats.",
        "Therefore, the complete and accurate answer that effectively explains how to clean wood blinds is:\nA: Close your blinds so they sit flat against your window. Wipe or dust each individual slat from left to right. Rotate the blinds and dust the other side."
