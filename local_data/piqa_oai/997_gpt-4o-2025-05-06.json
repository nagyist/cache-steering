        "To determine how to look up words in an Arabic dictionary, it is important to understand the structure and methodology used in Arabic dictionaries.",
        "Arabic words are often built from root letters, where a combination of these root letters along with different prefixes and suffixes form various words.",
        "Thus, the appropriate way to look up a word is usually to identify the root letters from which the derived forms are generated.",
        "Option A suggests contacting an Arabic professor which is unnecessary for standard dictionary use and does not align with typical methods for using dictionaries.",
