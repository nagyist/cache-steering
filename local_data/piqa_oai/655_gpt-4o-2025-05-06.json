    "steps": [
        "To disassemble a scrub brush, it is important to understand the typical construction of a scrub brush. Most scrub brushes consist of a handle and bristles, often held together by some type of slot or securing mechanism at the base.",
        "Given this information, the method to disassemble it would usually require a tool that can fit into the slot and apply leverage to separate the components.",
        "A hammer claw is generally used for pulling nails, not for prying open slots in small, delicate items like scrub brushes. Using a hammer claw could damage the brush or be unsafe.",
        "A flat head screwdriver is a more suitable tool for this task. It can easily fit into the slot at the base of the brush and is designed to apply leverage in a controlled manner. Therefore, using a flat head screwdriver to pry apart the components of a scrub brush is the correct method.",
        "So, based on the method's suitability and the tools' functions, the correct answer to disassembling a scrub brush is using a flat head screwdriver."
