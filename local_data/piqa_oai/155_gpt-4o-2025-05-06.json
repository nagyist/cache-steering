    "question": "How to make a leather jacket appear worn?\n\nChoices:\nA: Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the jacket and rub it in\nB: Apply a large amount of high proof alcohol on the jacket and rub it in",
    "steps": [
        "Leather jackets that appear worn often have a distressed look. Creating this look generally involves softening the leather and creating subtle wear marks.",
        "Applying a small amount of rubbing alcohol can help to slightly dry out the leather and create a slight roughness or worn texture without damaging the material extensively.",
        "In contrast, applying a large amount of high proof alcohol could significantly damage the leather. It might dry it out too much, cause discoloration, or even weaken the material.",
        "Therefore, a small amount of rubbing alcohol is more controlled and less likely to cause severe damage while still producing the desired worn look.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the jacket and rub it in."
