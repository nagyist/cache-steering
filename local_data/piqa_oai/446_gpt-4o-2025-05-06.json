    "question": "pliers\n\nChoices:\nA: can make a  marker bleed blood\nB: can make a  hand bleed blood",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the nature of \"pliers\" as a tool. Pliers are typically used for gripping, bending, and cutting materials, which means they have the capability to apply pressure or cut.",
        "Next, evaluate the choices provided. The first choice suggests that pliers can make a marker bleed blood, which is logically incorrect as markers are inanimate objects and do not contain blood. Therefore, pliers have no effect on making a marker bleed blood.",
        "The second choice suggests that pliers can make a hand bleed blood. Given that hands are part of the human body and do contain blood, it is possible for pliers to cause injury to a hand by cutting or applying significant pressure, potentially causing it to bleed.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: can make a hand bleed blood."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
