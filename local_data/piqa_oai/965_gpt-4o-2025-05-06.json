    "question": "Scrub hard bathroom stains.\n\nChoices:\nA: Mount a scrub to a power drill.\nB: Mount a scrub to a hair iron.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the purpose of scrubbing hard bathroom stains. This task requires significant force and continuous motion to be effective.",
        "Next, think about the two provided choices. One is a power drill, which is a tool specifically designed for powerful and rapid rotation, making it well-suited for tasks that need strong and continuous movement.",
        "The second option is a hair iron, which is an appliance designed for styling hair by applying heat. It does not provide the same kind of force or rotational movement that is needed for scrubbing hard stains.",
        "Finally, mounting a scrub to a power drill would harness the drill's rotating movement to make scrubbing easier and more effective, while mounting a scrub to a hair iron would be impractical and ineffective for this purpose.",
        "Therefore, the logical choice to scrub hard bathroom stains is to mount a scrub to a power drill."
