    "question": "how do you dry a towel?\n\nChoices:\nA: roll it up.\nB: let it hang.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the purpose of drying a towel, which is to remove moisture from it.",
        "Next, evaluate choice A: \"roll it up.\" If you roll up a wet towel, it will trap the moisture inside, making it difficult for the water to evaporate, and the towel will remain damp.",
        "Now, evaluate choice B: \"let it hang.\" When you hang a towel, it exposes a larger surface area to the air, allowing more airflow around the towel, and thereby aiding evaporation of the moisture.",
        "Compare the two options: Hanging the towel allows for better air circulation and faster drying, while rolling it up does not facilitate drying effectively.",
        "Given these considerations, the best method to dry a towel is to let it hang."
