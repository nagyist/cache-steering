Put on a concrete sealer.\nB: Let the concrete set for 48 hours. Remove the concrete from the metal form and sand down the corners. Put on a concrete sealer.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the curing process for concrete. Standard practice involves letting the concrete set and cure to gain strength before any further treatment.",
        "The typical recommendation is to allow concrete to set for a period of at least 48 hours to achieve sufficient initial hardness.",
        "After this initial set period, the concrete form needs to be removed, whether it's wooden or metal.",
        "Once the concrete is removed from the form, smoothing and preparing the surface is necessary, which might involve sanding down the corners.",
        "The final step is applying a concrete sealer to protect the concrete surface, prevent moisture penetration, and enhance durability.",
        "Most commonly, concrete is poured into wooden forms rather than metal forms.",
        "Therefore, the correct and expected method involves using wooden forms, aligning with option A: Let the concrete set for 48 hours. Remove the concrete from the wooden form and sand down the corners. Put on a concrete sealer."
