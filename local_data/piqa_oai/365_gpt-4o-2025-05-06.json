    "question": "How do avoid putting a shirt on backwards when both sides look the same?\n\nChoices:\nA: Look at the neckline and find the tag, and make sure the tag is in the back when you put it on.\nB: Look at the waistline and find the tag, and make sure the tag is in the back when you put it on.",
    "steps": [
        "When putting on a shirt that appears identical on both sides, you need a distinguishing feature that can indicate which side is the back and which is the front.",
        "Commonly, shirts have tags sewn into the interior at the neckline, which are intended to be at the back of the shirt.",
        "Thus, finding the tag on the neckline and ensuring it is positioned at the back would indicate correctly putting the shirt on without it being backwards.",
        "The waistline is generally not where tags are found; they are predominantly located at the neckline for easy visibility when the shirt is put on.",
        "Therefore, the correct method is to look at the neckline and find the tag, ensuring the tag is in the back when you put the shirt on."
