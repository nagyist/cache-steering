    "question": "Prevent waste of vegetable oil.\n\nChoices:\nA: Puncture lid foil with a fork.\nB: Puncture lid foil with a spoon.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the design and functionality of both a fork and a spoon. A fork has multiple sharp prongs while a spoon typically has a smooth and rounded shape.",
        "If the goal is to puncture lid foil efficiently, using an utensil with sharp prongs will be more effective than using a smooth, rounded utensil.",
        "With a fork, you can create several evenly spaced holes quickly, which would help in pouring the vegetable oil precisely and in controlled amounts.",
        "However, using a spoon where the foil punctures may be irregular and unevenly spaced might result in uncontrolled and excessive pouring.",
        "Therefore, between the fork and the spoon, the fork is the more practical choice for puncturing the lid foil, helping to prevent waste of vegetable oil."
