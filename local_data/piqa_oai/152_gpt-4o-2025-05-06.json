    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand what floating votive candles are. Floating candles are designed to float on water, typically in a decorative manner. Votive candles are smaller-sized candles used for decoration or religious offerings.",
        "To make a floating votive candle, we need a holder that will float on water while carrying the votive candle. A pool noodle is a buoyant material that can be used for this purpose. By cutting out sections from the pool noodle, we can create holders that will keep the candles afloat.",
        "Given the choices, we have two options: cutting small candle holders or large candle holders from the pool noodle. Small candle holders would likely be more appropriate for the size of votive candles, providing a snug and secure fit.",
        "Additionally, smaller holders will be less prone to tipping and will balance better on the water's surface, ensuring the votive candles remain upright and functional while floating.",
        "On the other hand, large candle holders may not fit the votive candles as well and could result in a loose fit, potentially causing the candle to tip over or sink.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is to cut small candle holders from a pool noodle to create floating votive candles."
