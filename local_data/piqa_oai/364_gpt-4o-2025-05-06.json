    "steps": [
        "The main task is to look for the correct step-by-step method to make stuffed figs as described in the question.",
        "First, both options suggest the same initial process: cutting a pocket in the side of dried figs using a paring knife.",
        "Second, both options prescribe tucking in a small thin strip of orange zest, a blanched almond, and a small piece of bittersweet chocolate into the pocket made in the figs.",
        "The primary difference between the two options lies in the final step and the cooling method used.",
        "Option A recommends dipping the bottoms of the figs in melted bittersweet chocolate and then chilling them on a parchment-lined baking sheet until set.",
        "Option B suggests dipping the bottoms of the figs in melted bittersweet chocolate and heated sizzle platter.",
        "A heated sizzle platter does not align with typical methods for setting chocolate, which typically involves cooling rather than additional heating.",
        "Therefore, chilling the figs on a parchment-lined baking sheet is the approach that ensures the figs are properly set and is consistent with normal culinary practices for chocolate.",
