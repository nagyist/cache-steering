    "question": "What is the best way to get dog fur off of my vest?\n\nChoices:\nA: Take a lint roller and roll all the fur off.\nB: Take a gatorade bottle and roll all the fur off.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the best way to remove dog fur from a vest, consider the tools mentioned in the options: a lint roller and a Gatorade bottle.",
        "A lint roller is specifically designed for removing lint, fur, and other small debris from clothing and fabrics.",
        "It typically consists of a roll of adhesive paper that can pick up and hold onto fur as it is rolled across the surface.",
        "Using a Gatorade bottle, on the other hand, is not a conventional method for removing fur and lacks the adhesive property to effectively capture and remove fur.",
        "Therefore, using a lint roller is the more practical and effective way to remove dog fur from a vest.",
        "Thus, option A: \"Take a lint roller and roll all the fur off.\" is the correct answer."
