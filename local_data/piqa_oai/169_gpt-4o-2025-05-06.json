    "question": "How do you put out a candle?\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut off the oxygen by covering the flame.\nB: hold it up higher than your head.",
    "steps": [
        "To put out a candle, the goal is to extinguish the flame. The flame requires oxygen to continue burning.",
        "If you cover the flame, you cut off its oxygen supply.",
        "Without oxygen, the chemical reaction that sustains the flame cannot occur, causing the flame to extinguish.",
        "Therefore, the correct way to put out a candle is by cutting off the oxygen by covering the flame.",
        "Holding the candle higher than your head doesn't affect the flame or its oxygen supply, so it wouldn't extinguish the flame.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Cut off the oxygen by covering the flame."
