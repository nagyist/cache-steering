        "To clean dried sticky soda out of a soda bottle, it is essential to dissolve the dried soda first.",
        "First, running hot water into the bottle until full and letting it sit overnight helps to soften and dissolve the dried soda residue.",
        "The next step is to empty out the water and add 1 tablespoon of soap to help break down any remaining residue.",
        "Filling the bottle with water ensures that the soap can mix well and reach all areas inside the bottle.",
        "Placing the lid on the bottle is crucial before shaking it, as it prevents the water and soap from spilling out during shaking.",
        "Shaking the bottle for 2 minutes agitates the mixture and helps to clean all surfaces inside the bottle thoroughly.",
        "Finally, rinsing the bottle clean with warm water removes any soap residue and ensures the bottle is clean.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Run hot water into the bottle until full, let sit overnight, empty out water, fill with 1 tbsp of soap, fill with water, place lid on, shake for 2 minutes, rinse clean with warm water."
