    "steps": [
        "First, evaluate the purpose and use of pants in relation to the provided choices.",
        "Consider what characteristics a flag typically has. A flag is often a piece of fabric, which can be waved or displayed, and pants can be made of fabric.",
        "Now, consider what characteristics a raincoat typically has, such as waterproof material and coverage. Pants generally do not have the necessary properties to function as a raincoat.",
        "Based on these evaluations, pants align more closely with the characteristics of a flag (as a piece of fabric) than with the characteristics of a raincoat.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Pants can be used as a flag."
