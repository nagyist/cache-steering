    "steps": [
        "Hickey is caused by blood vessels breaking and bleeding under the skin.",
        "Cold compresses can help reduce swelling and constrict blood vessels, potentially lessening the appearance of the hickey.",
        "A wet spoon, when placed in the freezer, will absorb the cold and can serve as a cold compress.",
        "Three minutes in the freezer might not be sufficient to make the spoon cold enough to be effective.",
        "Twenty minutes in the freezer will ensure the spoon is adequately chilled to serve as a cold compress.",
        "Therefore, placing a wet spoon in the freezer for 20 minutes and then laying it over the hickey is the correct method to help reduce its appearance."
