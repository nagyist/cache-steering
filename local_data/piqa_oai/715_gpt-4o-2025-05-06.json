    "question": "To make a clay snake,\n\nChoices:\nA: take a chunk of the polymer clay and roll it under your palms on a hard surface until it is longer and thinner.\nB: take a chunk of the polymer clay and roll it under your palms on a carpeted surface until it is longer and thinner.",
    "steps": [
        "Clay is easier to shape on hard surfaces because they provide more resistance.",
        "Rolling clay on a hard surface ensures that it becomes evenly elongated and thinned.",
        "Carpeted surfaces have texture and softness that could distort the clay\u2019s shape, making it harder to control.",
        "Therefore, rolling clay on a hard surface is the correct method for creating a uniform snake shape."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
