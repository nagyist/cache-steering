    "question": "Apply first coat of paint to ceiling.\n\nChoices:\nA: Hold the brush against the ceiling with the handle of the brush below the bristles. This will bend the bristles of the brush so the long fibers of the brush, rather than the tips, are in contact with the ceiling. Applying the brush this way will remove many of the brush marks that can be left behind by a paintbrush, and provide you with a smooth edge. Move on to the interior of the ceiling, overlapping the brushstrokes with a roller just slightly to provide a clean surface on the ceiling with no visible edge where the brushwork begins.\nB: Hold the brush roll down the ceiling with the handle of the brush below the bristles.

    "steps": [
        "The question is asking about the method to correctly apply the first coat of paint to the ceiling.",
        "To identify the steps involved in painting a ceiling effectively, one has to ensure the brush marks are minimized and that the paint is applied smoothly.",
        "Option A describes holding the brush against the ceiling with the handle below the bristles, which helps in reducing brush marks.",
        "Option A further suggests moving on to the interior part of the ceiling and overlapping brushstrokes with a roller to create a clean, smooth surface.",
        "Option B also suggests similar steps but starts with \"Hold the brush roll down the ceiling,\" which is unclear and not a common method referenced for painting ceilings.",
        "Given the detailed and correct steps provided in Option A, it is evident that Option A presents the proper method for applying the first coat of paint to the ceiling."
