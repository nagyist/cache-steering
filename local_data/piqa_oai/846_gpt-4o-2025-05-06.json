    "steps": [
        "First, let's consider the typical ingredients for a chocolate milkshake. A milkshake usually contains milk, ice cream, and a flavoring agent like chocolate syrup.",
        "Chocolate syrup is commonly used to add the chocolate flavor which mixes well with milk and vanilla ice cream.",
        "Vanilla ice cream is often the base for milkshakes because it blends smoothly and adds creaminess.",
        "Heavy cream is not a typical ingredient for milkshakes; it is richer and thicker than milk and could affect the texture.",
        "Chocolate ice cream could be used, but typically vanilla ice cream is preferred so the chocolate flavor from the syrup stands out.",
        "Given these considerations, the best method to make a chocolate milkshake aligns with option A.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: pour chocolate syrup into milk and vanilla ice cream and then blend it together."
