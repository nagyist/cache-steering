    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for cleaning a tent, we need to consider the efficiency and logic behind the cleaning process.",
        "First, identify that spot cleaning is aimed at removing concentrated dirt from specific areas.",
        "It would be logical to target the dirtiest areas first because these sections require more attention and cleaning effort.",
        "Spot cleaning the dirtiest areas first ensures that the concentrated dirt is dealt with before moving on to soaking the entire tent.",
        "After spot cleaning, submerging the tent in soapy water ensures that the overall tent is cleaned thoroughly.",
        "Rinsing the tent removes any remaining soap solution, and drying completes the cleaning process.",
        "Hence, the correct method involves spot cleaning the dirtiest areas first, followed by submersion, rinsing, and drying.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Spot clean the tent's dirtiest areas first with tent cleaner solution. Then submerge the tent in soapy water. Rinse and dry."
