    "question": "brick\n\nChoices:\nA: can break up stick figurines.\nB: can be used to make stick figures.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, we first need to understand the nature of a brick and its potential uses.",
        "Bricks are solid and heavy objects commonly used in construction, known for their strength and durability.",
        "Next, we consider what a stick figurine is. Stick figurines are typically simple models or drawings made out of thin materials like sticks.",
        "Now, we evaluate each choice in relation to how a brick interacts with stick figurines.",
        "Option A states, \"can break up stick figurines.\" Given the brick's properties (heavy and solid), it's reasonable to conclude that a brick could break or damage stick figurines.",
        "Option B states, \"can be used to make stick figures.\" Given the construction and application of bricks, this option doesn't make sense. Bricks are not thin materials suitable for making delicate stick figurines.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: can break up stick figurines."

    "solution": "A"
