    "question": "How can I create more distance from a water hose.\n\nChoices:\nA: Pressure (and thus distance) can be achieved by using a PVC expansion adapter.\nB: Pressure (and thus distance) can be achieved by using a PVC reducer adapter.",
    "steps": [
        "To create more distance from a water hose, increasing the pressure of the water flow is necessary.",
        "A PVC reducer adapter narrows the diameter of the hose at the end.",
        "By narrowing the diameter, the PVC reducer adapter increases the water pressure.",
        "Higher water pressure results in a longer spray distance from the hose.",
        "A PVC expansion adapter, on the other hand, increases the diameter and thus decreases the water pressure.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice to achieve greater distance is the PVC reducer adapter.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is: B: Pressure (and thus distance) can be achieved by using a PVC reducer adapter."

    "solution": "B"
