    "question": "Keep your rose bushes  healthy and blooming.\n\nChoices:\nA: After the blooms start to wilt, cut them off under the bloom.\nB: Before the blooms start to wilt, cut the buds off.",
    "steps": [
        "Healthy and blooming rose bushes require regular care and maintenance. This involves removing dead or wilted parts of the plant to encourage new growth and prevent disease.",
        "One common practice is deadheading, which refers to cutting off wilted or spent blooms. This helps the plant conserve energy that it would otherwise spend on developing seeds and encourages the production of new flowers.",
        "Option A suggests cutting the blooms off after they start to wilt. This aligns with the practice of deadheading and will promote continuous blooming.",
        "Option B suggests cutting the buds off before the blooms start to wilt. Removing buds prematurely will prevent the plant from flowering at all, which is counterproductive to maintaining a healthy and blooming rose bush.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: After the blooms start to wilt, cut them off under the bloom."
