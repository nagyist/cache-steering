    "question": "To trim away excess cord.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a pair of scissors to cut the extra cord after making a knot.\nB: Use a pair of tongs to cut the extra cord after making a knot.",
    "steps": [
        "When trimming away excess cord, an appropriate tool is needed to perform the cutting. This tool needs to have a sharp edge to effectively cut through the material.",
        "Among the given choices, option A suggests using a pair of scissors, which are specifically designed for cutting materials like cord, paper, fabric, etc., with their sharp blades. This makes scissors the suitable tool for this task.",
        "Option B suggests using a pair of tongs, which are generally used for gripping and holding objects, not cutting. Tongs do not typically have a sharp edge required for cutting cord, making them an ineffective tool for this task.",
        "Given this reasoning, the appropriate choice for trimming away excess cord is A: Use a pair of scissors to cut the extra cord after making a knot."
