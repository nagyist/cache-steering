    "question": "To hit the rest button on an electronic device,\n\nChoices:\nA: use a marker point.\nB: use a fine tip of a pen.",
    "steps": [
        "Electronic devices often have small reset buttons that are recessed or difficult to access with fingers because they are designed to prevent accidental resets.",
        "These buttons are typically small enough that they require a tool to press them. The fine tip of a pen is appropriate as it can easily fit into the small space and press the button correctly.",
        "On the other hand, a marker point is usually broader and may not fit into the small reset button space, making it ineffective for this purpose.",
        "Therefore, using a fine tip of a pen to hit the reset button on an electronic device is the correct choice."

    "solution": "B"
