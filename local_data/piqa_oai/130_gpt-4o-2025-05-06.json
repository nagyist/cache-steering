    "question": "screws\n\nChoices:\nA: can remove mold from clay\nB: can secure mold to clay",
    "steps": [
        "First, I need to understand what screws can do in general. Screws are designed to fasten or secure materials together by turning them into objects to create a tight bond.",
        "Next, I need to consider the two choices given:\nA: can remove mold from clay\nB: can secure mold to clay",
        "Choice A seems unlikely because screws are not used to remove stuff; they are used for securing or fastening things.",
        "Choice B is more plausible because molding objects often involves attaching them firmly together, and screws can be used for securing the mold to the clay.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: can secure mold to clay."

    "solution": "B"
