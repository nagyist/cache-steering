    "question": "grater\n\nChoices:\nA: cuts veggies bloody\nB: cuts fingers bloody",
    "steps": [
        "Consider what a grater is typically used for and its design. A grater is a kitchen utensil used to shred or slice food items, especially vegetables and cheese, into finer pieces.",
        "Think about how a grater is used. It involves rubbing the food item against the surface of the grater, which has sharp edges or holes designed to shred the item.",
        "Now, consider the choices given: 'cuts veggies bloody' and 'cuts fingers bloody'.",
        "'Cuts veggies bloody' doesn't make logical sense because vegetables do not bleed. This choice can be ruled out.",
        "On the other hand, 'cuts fingers bloody' makes logical sense. When using a grater, if one is not careful, it is possible to accidentally rub one's fingers against the sharp edges, resulting in cuts and potentially causing bleeding.",
        "Given this reasoning, the correct answer is B: cuts fingers bloody."

    "solution": "B"
