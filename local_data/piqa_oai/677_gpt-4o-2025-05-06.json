        "Acne medicine needs to be effective while also being gentle enough not to cause harm or irritation to the skin. Some ingredients are known for their beneficial effects on acne, while others can exacerbate the problem.",
        "Nutmeg has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce the appearance of acne scars. Honey is well known for its antibacterial properties and also helps to soothe and moisturize the skin.",
        "Ghost pepper, on the other hand, is extremely hot and can cause severe irritation, burning sensations, and potential damage to the skin. It's not suitable for topical application for acne.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice would be a mixture of ingredients that are safe and beneficial for the skin.",
        "Choice B: Mix a teaspoon of Nutmeg, a tablespoon of Honey into a paste and put this on the acne, leave for 30 min. then rinse. Repeat daily as needed. This approach uses both Nutmeg and Honey, which are appropriate ingredients for acne treatment.",
        "This mixture is safe, effective, and can be repeated daily as needed.",
