    "steps": [
        "To determine which method is appropriate for frying french fries, we need to understand the usual process of making them crispy and thoroughly cooked.",
        "French fries are traditionally deep-fried, which involves immersing them in hot oil. This method ensures even cooking and achieves the desired crispy texture.",
        "Option A describes saut\u00e9ing, which typically uses a small amount of oil and involves cooking at a lower heat. This method is more suited for softer cooking tasks and doesn't achieve the deep-fried effect required for crispy fries.",
        "Option B mentions heating oil to 300\u00b0F and cooking the fries for 3-5 minutes, which matches the standard process of deep-frying. This temperature and method ensure that the fries are cooked evenly and become crispy.",
        "Considering the correct method for making crispy french fries, Option B is the appropriate choice."
