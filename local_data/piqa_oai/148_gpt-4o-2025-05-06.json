    "steps": [
        "To determine how to dry a towel quickly without a dryer, we need to consider the environmental conditions that can facilitate faster drying.",
        "A key factor in drying items is airflow. Better airflow helps to evaporate moisture quicker. Windy conditions typically provide better airflow compared to indoor environments.",
        "Another important factor is humidity. Outdoor areas, especially on a windy day, generally have lower relative humidity than indoor areas, which could further aid in quicker evaporation of moisture from the towel.",
        "Considering these factors, hanging the towel in a windy area outside would result in faster drying than hanging it inside, even if inside is dry, because the constant movement of air outside promotes quicker evaporation.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice for drying a towel quickly without a dryer is B: Hang the towel over a hanger outside in a windy area and allow it to dry."
