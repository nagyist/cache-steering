    "steps": [
        "First, understand what it means to line a baking pan with parchment. Lining a baking pan involves covering the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking and make cleanup easier.",
        "Next, evaluate each choice step by step to determine which one properly describes this process.",
        "Choice A: \"open the box, and pull the parchment to the desired length, tear off, and place on baking sheet.\"\n- Open the box of parchment paper.\n- Pull out the parchment paper to the length you need to cover the bottom and possibly the sides of the baking pan.\n- Tear off the parchment paper.\n- Place it on the baking sheet as required.",
        "Choice B: \"Place the box of parchment on the pan, and tear off double the amount you need. Fold parchment over the box, and secure.\"\n- Place the box on the pan.\n- Tear off double the amount needed.\n- Fold parchment over the box and secure.\nThis choice does not directly state how to place parchment on the baking sheet; it sounds more complicated and not the typical method for lining a pan.",
        "Comparing both choices, Choice A provides a clear and straightforward way to line the baking sheet, described in conventional steps one would follow when using parchment paper for baking.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: open the box, and pull the parchment to the desired length, tear off, and place on baking sheet."
