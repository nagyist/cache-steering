    "question": "How do you get oil off of tortillas?\n\nChoices:\nA: After frying them, lay them on a few layers of paper towels to absorb the excess.\nB: After frying them, lay them on a few layers of rubber mats to absorb the excess.",
    "steps": [
        "Frying tortillas typically results in excess oil on their surface.",
        "To remove this excess oil, an absorbent material must be used.",
        "Paper towels are commonly used in kitchens for their absorbent properties.",
        "Rubber mats, on the other hand, are not absorbent and would not effectively remove oil.",
        "Therefore, laying fried tortillas on a few layers of paper towels would be a practical and effective way to absorb the excess oil.",
        "Thus, the correct choice is A: After frying them, lay them on a few layers of paper towels to absorb the excess."
