    "steps": [
        "Magic wands are traditionally considered to be smaller and more portable objects.",
        "The choice between centimeters and inches is a matter of scale. Centimeters are smaller units than inches.",
        "32 inches would be much longer than typically practical for a magic wand, implying it would be about the size of a staff.",
        "32 centimeters is a more reasonable size, aligning with the typical size of a magic wand (usually between 25-40 cm).",
        "Historical and fictional references often suggest that magic wands are about a foot long, which is approximately 30 centimeters.",
        "Thus, the most appropriate length for a magic wand is 32 centimeters, making the correct choice A."
