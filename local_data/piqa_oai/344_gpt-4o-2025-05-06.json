This kills all germs.\nB: Go outside and dig up some dirt. Carefully spread thin on a cookie sheet and let sit in sun for 10 minutes. This kills all germs.",
    "steps": [
        "Creating your own potting soil requires ensuring that the dirt is free from germs and pathogens to foster healthy plant growth.",
        "Heating soil is a common method to sterilize it, as heat effectively kills germs, bacteria, and other pathogens.",
        "Baking the dirt at high temperatures (such as in an oven) will reach consistent and sufficiently high heat to ensure the destruction of germs.",
        "While sunlight can help dry the soil, it does not provide a controlled or sufficient temperature to kill all germs within a short time period like 10 minutes.",
        "Therefore, option A, which involves baking the soil, is the correct choice since it will effectively kill all germs through consistent high heat."
