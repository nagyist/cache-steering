    "question": "clay\n\nChoices:\nA: can be molded into shapes by a dog\nB: can be molded with paws by a dog",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the properties of clay: it is a malleable material that can be shaped and molded.",
        "A dog primarily uses its paws to interact with objects, as it does not have hands to grasp and shape in a precise manner like humans.",
        "Choice A suggests that a dog can mold clay specifically into shapes, which implies a level of precision and sculpting ability that dogs do not possess.",
        "Choice B suggests that a dog can mold clay with its paws, which is more plausible given that dogs can dig and make indents with their paws but may not create specific shapes.",
        "Therefore, the more accurate answer aligning with the abilities of a dog is B."

    "solution": "B"
