    "steps": [
        "The task is to store and identify bed sheet sets easily.",
        "Option A suggests putting the bed sheet sets inside a garbage bag.",
        "Option B suggests putting the folded sheets inside of the pillowcase.",
        "Storing bed sheet sets inside a garbage bag can be impractical, as garbage bags are typically opaque and lack organization. This makes it harder to identify and retrieve specific sets.",
        "On the other hand, putting the folded sheets inside the pillowcase keeps all components of the sheet set together in one tidy package. Additionally, pillowcases are usually labeled or visually identifiable, making it easier to find and retrieve the correct set.",
        "Considering practicality and ease of identification, option B is a more effective solution.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: put the folded sheets inside of the pillow case."
