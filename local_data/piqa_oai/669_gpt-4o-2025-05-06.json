    "steps": [
        "To peel a potato by boiling away the skin, you need to understand the process required to make the skin easy to remove.",
        "First, place your potatoes in a large pot with plenty of water. This ensures they are fully submerged and cook evenly.",
        "If you'd like, score your potatoes. This step is optional but can make peeling even easier later.",
        "Bring the pot to a boil and cook the potatoes for about 15 minutes. The boiling process will loosen the skins.",
        "Once the potatoes are cooked through, you need to rapidly cool them to further loosen the skin. The correct method for this is to immerse them one by one in ice cold water for 5-10 seconds.",
        "Freezer immersion is not practical for this process because ice cold water provides the immediate cooling needed.",
        "Finally, peel off the skin. The rapid cooling makes this step easy.",
