    "steps": [
        "Driving requires alertness and focus to ensure safety.",
        "Color can play a role in maintaining alertness. Studies show different colors can affect the brain and mood.",
        "Yellow is a bright, attention-grabbing color and is often used in warning signs to keep people alert. Staring at something yellow can stimulate the brain and help keep one awake.",
        "Black, on the other hand, is a less stimulating color that may not have the same alertness-boosting effect as yellow.",
        "Therefore, staring at a yellow cloth during traffic stops is more effective for staying awake while driving.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Keep a yellow cloth in car to stare at during traffic stops."
