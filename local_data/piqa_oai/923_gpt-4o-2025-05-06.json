    "question": "How can I make more room in a kitchen?\n\nChoices:\nA: Hang pots and pans on a black board.\nB: Hang pots and pans on a peg board.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the problem: needing to make more room in the kitchen.",
        "Next, analyze the choices given. Choice A suggests hanging pots and pans on a blackboard. A blackboard is typically used for writing or drawing and doesn't have a design conducive to hanging heavy items like pots and pans securely.",
        "Choice B suggests hanging pots and pans on a pegboard. A pegboard is specifically designed with multiple holes that accommodate pegs or hooks that can hold various kitchen items, including pots and pans, thus freeing up more space effectively.",
        "By comparing the functionality and adaptability of a blackboard versus a pegboard, it becomes clear that a pegboard is better suited for hanging kitchen items and providing more room.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Hang pots and pans on a peg board."
