    "question": "To speed up the process of cooking food in restaurants,\n\nChoices:\nA: cook the food on heat that is twice as hot as usual to save time.\nB: have as much of the food prepped ahead of time as possible.",
    "steps": [
        "Cooking the food on heat that is twice as hot as usual can lead to a number of problems. It increases the risk of burning the food, results in uneven cooking, and can degrade the quality and taste of many dishes. Therefore, this is not a reliable method to speed up the cooking process in a restaurant while maintaining food quality.",
        "Having as much of the food prepped ahead of time allows for streamlined cooking during service hours. Prepping includes tasks such as chopping vegetables, marinating meats, and preparing sauces, which are time-consuming and can be done in advance. This practice helps in reducing the cooking time and ensures that meal preparation is quicker without compromising quality.",
        "Restaurants that utilize prep work effectively can serve food more swiftly because the chefs can quickly combine pre-prepared ingredients to complete dishes, rather than starting from scratch each time an order is placed.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: have as much of the food prepped ahead of time as possible."
