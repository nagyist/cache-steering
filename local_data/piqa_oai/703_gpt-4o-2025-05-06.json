    "steps": [
        "First, recognize that removing strings from a guitar requires disassembling them from the tuning pegs where they are secured.",
        "The strings on a guitar are typically wound around the tuning pegs, so to remove them, the proper method is to unwind them.",
        "Using scissors (Option A) is not a conventional or recommended method as it can damage the guitar and does not properly remove the strings.",
        "Option B describes the correct method of unwinding the strings using the tuning pegs and then unwrapping them, which ensures the strings are properly removed without causing damage.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Unwind the strings using the tuning pegs, and unwrap them to take them off."
