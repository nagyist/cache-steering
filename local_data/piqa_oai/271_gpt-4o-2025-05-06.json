    "question": "How to best mow the lawn\n\nChoices:\nA: Using a lawn mower that's running, walk back and forth pushing it over the grass to be cut. If you go diagonally it gives it a cool look.\nB: Borrow a goat from a nearby farm if you don't own one and let that goat hang out in the yard as long as possible so it can eat the grass and keep it cut.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the best method to mow the lawn, we first need to consider practicality and effectiveness.",
        "Option B suggests borrowing a goat to eat the grass. While goats can graze and help keep grass short, they are not as precise or consistent as a lawn mower. Also, borrowing a goat may not be practical for everyone.",
        "Option A proposes using a lawn mower, which is specifically designed for cutting grass efficiently and evenly. It also suggests mowing diagonally for a cool look, which can give the lawn a neat and aesthetically pleasing appearance.",
        "Overall, using a lawn mower is more controlled, effective, and practical for most people compared to relying on a goat.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Using a lawn mower that's running, walk back and forth pushing it over the grass to be cut. If you go diagonally it gives it a cool look."
