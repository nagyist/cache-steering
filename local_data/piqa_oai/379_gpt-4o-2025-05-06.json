    "steps": [
        "First, identify the common usage and meaning of the word 'dish'.",
        "A dish is typically a container used to hold or serve food, but it can also hold other substances like water.",
        "Eliminate choices that are clearly incorrect or do not make sense. Choice A: 'can be filled with water toothpaste' does not logically make sense because a dish cannot be filled with toothpaste when considering common usage.",
        "Evaluate remaining choices based on common sense and context. Choice B: 'can be filled with water hose' logically makes sense as a hose can be used to fill the dish with water.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is choice B."

    "solution": "B"
