    "steps": [
        "Cheesecake batter can easily trap air bubbles during the mixing process.",
        "If these air bubbles are not eliminated before baking, they can expand and cause cracks or uneven texture in the cheesecake.",
        "Pounding the pan on the counter top before baking helps to release any trapped air bubbles from the batter.",
        "Doing this after baking would not help because by then the cheesecake has already set and the air bubbles have solidified within the texture.",
        "Therefore, to prevent air bubbles in cheesecake, the pan should be pounded on the counter top a few times before baking."
