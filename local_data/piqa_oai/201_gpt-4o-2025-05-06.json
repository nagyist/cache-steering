    "steps": [
        "First, let's examine the ingredients mentioned in both choices and their roles in keeping fleas away from dogs. We know that certain natural ingredients like witch hazel, vodka, and apple cider vinegar can be effective in repelling fleas.",
        "The main difference between the two choices lies in the liquid base used for the spray: one uses distilled milk (Choice A) and the other uses distilled water (Choice B).",
        "Using milk as a solvent in Choice A is unusual and not very practical for a flea spray. Milk can spoil and go rancid quickly which could create an unpleasant smell and potentially cause issues for your dog's skin or fur.",
        "Distilled water, as used in Choice B, is a much more appropriate and effective base. It is safe, does not spoil, and provides a neutral carrier for the other ingredients (witch hazel, vodka, and apple cider vinegar) to work effectively against fleas.",
        "All other aspects of the instructions in both choices are consistent. Thus, the use of distilled water is the clear and logical choice for a natural flea spray for your dog.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is:"
