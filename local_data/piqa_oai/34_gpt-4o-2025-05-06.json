    "question": "What can I use for fuel in an alcohol stove?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use acetone.\nB: Use vinegar.",
    "steps": [
        "Alcohol stoves generally require a combustible liquid that can produce a clean flame. The options given are acetone and vinegar.",
        "Consider the properties of acetone: It is a flammable liquid, which means it can be used as fuel in an alcohol stove.",
        "Consider the properties of vinegar: It is primarily a mixture of water and acetic acid. Even if it contains ethanol, the high water content makes it ineffective as a fuel for an alcohol stove.",
        "Therefore, between the two options, acetone is clearly the suitable fuel for an alcohol stove."
