    "question": "old shirt\n\nChoices:\nA: can clean oil spill \nB: can clean clothes ",
    "steps": [
        "Analyze the purpose of the choices given and how they relate to the item, an \"old shirt.\"",
        "Choice A states \"can clean oil spill,\" which implies using an old shirt to absorb or remove oil. This is a practical and possible use of an old shirt in a situation of needing a disposable cleaning material.",
        "Choice B states \"can clean clothes,\" which suggests that an old shirt can be used to clean other clothes. This is not logical because an old shirt is worn out and used, making it ineffective for cleaning clothes.",
        "Therefore, between the two choices, the more logical and practical use of an old shirt is to clean an oil spill.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is Choice A: can clean oil spill."
