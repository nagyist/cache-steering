    "steps": [
        "Tempering batter usually involves mixing it with a hot liquid without causing it to curdle or cook instantly.",
        "Adding a small amount of hot liquid to the batter slowly and stirring allows the batter to gradually adjust to the temperature difference.",
        "This gradual adjustment helps maintain a smooth consistency in the batter.",
        "Pouring all of the hot liquid into the batter at once can cause it to cook too quickly, leading to lumps or curdling.",
        "Thus, slowly adding 1/3 cup of hot liquid to the batter, stirring, and then pouring it back into the rest of the hot liquid (choice A) is the correct method to temper batter."
