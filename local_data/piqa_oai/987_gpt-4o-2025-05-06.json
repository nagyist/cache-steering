    "question": "how do you take a break on something?\n\nChoices:\nA: take it a little at a time.\nB: set it aside for a little while.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to analyze what \"taking a break on something\" means. Taking a break generally implies stopping an activity temporarily to rest or to do something different.",
        "Option A suggests \"take it a little at a time,\" which implies continuing the activity but at a slower pace rather than completely stopping it. This is not the same as taking a break, as it involves ongoing effort.",
        "Option B suggests \"set it aside for a little while.\" This implies stopping the activity entirely for a period of time and then returning to it later. This fits the idea of taking a break, as taking breaks usually involves ceasing what you are doing and returning to it after a short rest.",
        "Considering the definitions and implications of both options, the correct interpretation of \"taking a break\" aligns with setting the activity aside for a while (Option B).",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: set it aside for a little while."
