        "To determine how to soak something, we need to understand what it means to \"soak.\"",
        "\"Soaking\" typically involves immersing an object in a liquid, usually water, to make it wet or saturated.",
        "Choice A involves putting something in a tub, but it doesn't specifically mention water or any liquid, so it doesn't fully explain the soaking process.",
