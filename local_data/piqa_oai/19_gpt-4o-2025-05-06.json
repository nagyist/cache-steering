    "steps": [
        "First, consider how chalk is used in everyday scenarios.",
        "Chalk is typically used by holding it in your hand and making contact with a surface, similar to how you use a pen or pencil.",
        "The surface most commonly associated with chalk usage is either a chalkboard or pavement.",
        "Melting chalk would not be practical or effective as it would lose its solid form and the ability to mark a surface clearly.",
        "Therefore, the correct method would be to use chalk in a way similar to a pen, making direct contact with the pavement and drawing.",
        "Given the choices, B: use the chalk like a pen on pavement, is the correct answer."
