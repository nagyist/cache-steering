        "Post-its are sticky notes typically used for reminders; once they are no longer needed, they can be repurposed before being discarded.",
        "The effective use mentioned in the question is to clean crumbs and fluff from between keyboard keys.",
        "Leaving post-its between the keys will not effectively collect crumbs and fluff, as the sticky part will not be in direct contact with the debris.",
