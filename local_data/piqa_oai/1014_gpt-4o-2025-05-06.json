    "steps": [
        "Wearing new shoes can often cause discomfort and pain, particularly in the heel area where friction is most common.",
        "The problem arises because of the direct contact and rubbing between the heel and the new, often stiff, material inside the shoe.",
        "To mitigate the pain, the goal is to reduce the friction and cushion the area that is being rubbed.",
        "Placing a plaster on the heel inside the shoe creates a protective barrier between the heel and the shoe, reducing direct contact and minimizing friction.",
        "Putting a plaster on the outside of the shoe would not be effective because it doesn't address the point of friction occurring inside the shoe.",
        "Therefore, the most effective solution is to place a plaster on the heel inside the shoe to prevent pain as you wear them in."
