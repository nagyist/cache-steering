    "steps": [
        "Wasps can be dangerous and cause painful stings, so it is important to wear protective clothing to protect yourself.",
        "Using a pesticide spray is effective in eliminating wasps because it is specifically designed to kill insects, including wasps.",
        "Spraying the nest for about 15 seconds ensures that the pesticide fully covers the nest and reaches all areas where the wasps may be.",
        "Leaving the nest alone overnight allows the pesticide to work effectively and ensures that any remaining wasps are killed.",
        "Inspecting the nest the next day for wasp activity helps confirm whether the pesticide was effective and that it is safe to proceed with removing the nest.",
        "Using a long stick to knock down the nest ensures that you keep a safe distance from any remaining wasps or debris from the nest.",
        "Hairspray is not effective for killing wasps, and spraying for 15 minutes would be impractical and potentially dangerous.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Wear protective clothing, and use a pesticide spray to spray the nest for about 15 seconds. Leave it alone overnight, and come back the next day. If there appears to be no more wasp activity around the nest, use a long stick to knock it down and dispose of."
