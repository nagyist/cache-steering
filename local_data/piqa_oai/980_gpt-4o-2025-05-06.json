    "question": "Prevent bar soap sliding.\n\nChoices:\nA: Keep soap in cut piece of tights.\nB: Keep soap in cut piece of jeans.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider why bar soap slides. It typically happens because of water and the smooth surface becoming slippery.",
        "To prevent soap from sliding, we need a material that can maintain grip even when wet.",
        "Option A suggests using a cut piece of tights. Tights are stretchy and can conform well around an object, creating a better grip.",
        "Option B suggests using a cut piece of jeans. While jeans are sturdy, they are not as stretchy and flexible as tights, and they may not provide a secure grip around the soap.",
        "Since tights can grip the soap better when wet and are less likely to slip themselves, they are more suitable for preventing the soap from sliding.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Keep soap in cut piece of tights."
