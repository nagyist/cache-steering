    "steps": [
        "To figure out how to prevent static cling on clothes without using dryer sheets, first, we need to understand how static cling is typically prevented in the laundry process.",
        "Static cling occurs when fabrics rub together in the dryer, causing an exchange of electrons that makes the fabrics cling together. Dryer sheets contain chemicals that balance the electron exchange to reduce cling.",
        "Without dryer sheets, we need an alternative method to disrupt this electron exchange or facilitate separation of the fabrics.",
        "One common alternative to dryer sheets mentioned is using aluminum foil, which can be effective due to its conductive properties.",
        "We need to decide how to use aluminum foil properly. Let's examine the options.",
        "Option A suggests tearing three 2-foot length sheets of aluminum foil and folding them into dryer sheet pieces, then tossing them in the washer with the clothes. However, this does not seem practical as foil pieces might not survive the washing cycle undamaged.",
        "Option B suggests tearing three 2-foot length sheets of aluminum foil, bunching them into palm-sized balls, and tossing them in the dryer with the clothes. This method uses the foil balls in the dryer, where static cling actually occurs, and the balls can help keep clothes separated, reducing rubbing.",
        "Option B addresses the static cling issue directly in the dryer, aligns with typical household tips for reducing static cling, and provides a logical and practical solution.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer to prevent static cling without using dryer sheets is B."
