    "steps": [
        "First, consider the physical characteristics of a television. A television typically has a flat surface on top, but is not very large or stable enough to hold heavy objects.",
        "Next, evaluate the two choices: a table and a stone. A table is generally large, heavy, and has a large footprint which makes it impractical to place on top of a television.",
        "On the other hand, a stone, depending on its size and weight, could be placed on top of a television without causing instability or damage.",
        "Therefore, the most practical and safe option between a table and a stone to be placed on top of a television would be a stone.",
        "Thus, the answer is B: Can hold stone on top of it."
