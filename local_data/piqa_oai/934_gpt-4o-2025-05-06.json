    "question": "How to use a mold release product\n\nChoices:\nA: use a spray can and heavily coat the inside and outside of the mold.\nB: paint the inside of the mold with the product, using a paintbrush.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand what a mold release product is. A mold release product is used to prevent the molding material from sticking to the mold.",
        "Next, we consider the methods mentioned in the choices. Option A suggests using a spray can to heavily coat both the inside and outside of the mold. This approach seems excessive and could lead to oversaturation, potentially affecting the molding process or creating waste.",
        "Option B suggests using a paintbrush to apply the product inside the mold. This method allows for more control and precise application, ensuring that the release agent is evenly distributed without using too much product.",
        "The goal is to ensure that the molding material does not stick while avoiding over-application of the release agent. Therefore, painting the inside of the mold with a product using a paintbrush is a more efficient and practical method.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: paint the inside of the mold with the product, using a paintbrush."
