    "question": "When filling metal molds, how do I ensure all the small voids are filled?\n\nChoices:\nA: Blow on the molten metal to push it into the voids.\nB: Add extra molten metal to the mold to increase pressure and drive the metal into the voids.",
    "steps": [
        "To ensure all small voids in metal molds are filled properly, you need a method that effectively pushes molten metal into these voids.",
        "Blowing on molten metal would not generate enough force to push the molten metal into the tiny voids. Additionally, blowing could cause safety issues and contamination.",
        "Adding extra molten metal to the mold increases the pressure within the mold. Higher pressure helps drive the molten metal into small voids, ensuring they are filled properly.",
        "Therefore, the correct method to ensure all small voids are filled is to add extra molten metal to the mold to increase pressure.",
        "The correct answer is B: Add extra molten metal to the mold to increase pressure and drive the metal into the voids."

    "solution": "B"
