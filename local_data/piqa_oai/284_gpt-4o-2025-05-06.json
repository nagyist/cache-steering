        "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what is required to play slide guitar without a traditional slide.",
        "Slide guitar involves using a smooth, hard object to glide across the strings, creating a distinctive sound.",
        "Both choices mention using a rounded glass or metal instrument, which is suitable for creating the slide guitar effect.",
