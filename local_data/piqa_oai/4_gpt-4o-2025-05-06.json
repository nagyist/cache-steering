    "steps": [
        "Let's analyze the given question: 'Clean tires.'",
        "Option A suggests using 'cape off caked on dirt' and 'speed wool' for cleaning the crevices and sparrow spaces.",
        "Option B suggests using 'scrape off caked on dirt' and 'steel wool' for cleaning the crevices and narrow spaces.",
        "We need to compare the terms and effectiveness related to cleaning tires.",
        "To 'scrape off' dirt makes more sense than 'cape off' which seems incorrect or less effective.",
