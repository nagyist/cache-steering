    "steps": [
        "To squeeze lemons easily without a citrus juicer, you need to consider how to extract the juice effectively.",
        "Using kitchen tongs can provide the leverage needed to apply sufficient pressure to the lemon.",
        "Placing a whole lemon between the tongs will not be as effective because the intact peel and structure of the lemon will resist squeezing.",
        "Cutting the lemon provides access to the juice sacs inside, making it easier to extract juice when pressure is applied.",
        "Using kitchen tongs to squeeze a cut lemon ensures maximum pressure is directly applied to the juicy interior, allowing efficient extraction of the juice.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Use a pair of kitchen tongs, place the cut lemon between the two parts of the tong and squeeze outside the tongs and juice."
