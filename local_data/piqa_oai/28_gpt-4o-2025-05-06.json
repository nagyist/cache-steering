    "steps": [
        "First, consider the initial action to take when preparing a bath. Typically, the goal is to collect water in the bathtub.",
        "To collect water, you need to ensure it doesn't drain away. This requires plugging the drain.",
        "Next, focus on how you get water into the tub. This involves turning on the faucet and adjusting the water to the desired temperature, usually warm or hot.",
        "After establishing a good temperature, the next step is to fill the tub. It's common to wait until the bath is at least half full but not completely full to avoid overflow.",
        "Finally, consider any additional elements, such as adding soap. This is optional and can be done once the bath is partially full.",
        "Comparing the two choices, we see that option B accurately describes plugging the drain to collect water first, and then following the subsequent steps to prepare the bath."
