    "steps": [
        "First, identify the key part of the question that seems to be missing and try to understand what is implied. The phrase \"crossing out\" might suggest we need to ignore or remove something, but it could also simply be part of a more complex sentence.",
        "Next, look at the choices available. Both choices deal with 'patterns' adding aesthetic value to an object - either a tissue or a placemat.",
        "Understand the context of usage for each object mentioned in the choices. A tissue is typically used for practical, disposable purposes and patterns on it are generally less noticed or valued for aesthetics.",
        "A placemat, on the other hand, is often used in dining settings where visual appeal can make a significant contribution. Therefore, having patterns on a placemat can indeed make it aesthetically nicer, adding to the overall dining experience.",
        "Given the options, consider practicality and common usage. Patterns on a placemat are more likely to be noticed and appreciated compared to a tissue.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: 'patterns on placemat make it nicer.'"

    "solution": "B"
