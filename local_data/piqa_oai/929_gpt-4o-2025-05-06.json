        "Understand the purpose of the question: It is asking which finish is appropriate for a handle.",
        "Evaluate the choices provided:\nA: Apply bleach to the handle three or four times with a light sanding between each application.\nB: Apply three or four coats of Danish oil to the handle and give it a light sanding between each application.",
        "Consider the typical use of finishes on handles:\nBleach is generally used for sanitizing or cleaning purposes, not as a finish. \nDanish oil is commonly used to finish wood, giving it a protective layer and improving its appearance.",
        "Review the process of application in each choice:\nChoice B specifically mentions applying several coats of Danish oil, which is a recognized method for finishing wood to protect and beautify it.\nChoice A mentions applying bleach, which does not relate to finishing but rather to cleaning.",
