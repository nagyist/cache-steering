    "question": "How do you prevent your sandwich from being stolen?\n\nChoices:\nA: Using your green color permanent marker, add some mold to the sandwich bag.\nB: Using your green and red color permanent markers, add tulips to the sandwich bag.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the objective: preventing the sandwich from being stolen.",
        "Evaluate option A: adding some mold to the sandwich bag with a green color permanent marker. Mold on food typically signifies that the food has spoiled or is unappetizing.",
        "Assess how the appearance of mold would deter a potential thief. Most people avoid spoiled-looking food due to health concerns and a lack of appeal.",
        "Evaluate option B: adding tulips to the sandwich bag with green and red color permanent markers. Tulips are decorative elements that generally make an object more visually appealing.",
        "Consider whether the addition of tulips would effectively deter a thief. Decoration does not typically imply the food is spoiled, and it may even enhance its attractiveness.",
        "Compare the effectiveness of both strategies. A mold appearance strongly suggests spoilage and is more likely to prevent theft than decorative tulips.",
        "Conclude that the best option for preventing sandwich theft is making the sandwich look unappetizing and spoiled.",
        "Thus, the answer is A: Using your green color permanent marker, add some mold to the sandwich bag."
