        "First, identify the key elements required for making Mushroom Amatriciana. This typically involves pasta, mushrooms, garlic, onions, and other common ingredients found in Amatriciana sauce (like tomatoes).",
        "Next, determine which choice involves pasta. Since Amatriciana is traditionally a pasta dish, the option involving pasta is more likely the right way to go.",
