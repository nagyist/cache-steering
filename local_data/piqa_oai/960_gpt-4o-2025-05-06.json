    "question": "To cut a hole into the bottom of a can.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a step drill bit and a drill to drill a hole into the bottom of the can, widen the hole by biting off the metal around the edge of the drilled hole.\nB: Use a step drill bit and a drill to drill a hole into the bottom of the can. Use the same drill bit to widen the hole until the hole is the desired size.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct way to cut a hole into the bottom of a can, we need to analyze the practicality and effectiveness of each method presented.",
        "A step drill bit is specifically designed to create holes in thin materials like metal. This type of drill bit progressively enlarges the hole as it goes deeper, making it suitable for widening holes.",
        "Option A suggests using a step drill bit to start the hole, then biting off the metal around the edge to widen it further. This method is impractical and unsafe as it would require manual effort to remove the metal, risking uneven edges and potential injury.",
        "Option B suggests using the step drill bit to both create and widen the hole to the desired size. This method ensures a clean and precise hole while utilizing the tool's intended purpose.",
        "Given the design and functionality of a step drill bit, the correct answer is the method that efficiently and safely uses the tool to achieve the desired outcome without unnecessary risk.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Use a step drill bit and a drill to drill a hole into the bottom of the can. Use the same drill bit to widen the hole until the hole is the desired size."
