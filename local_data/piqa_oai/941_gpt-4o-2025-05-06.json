    "steps": [
        "First, analyze the term \"bin\" which usually refers to a container used for storage. A bin's typical function is to hold various items.",
        "The choice \"can hold negative vacuum easily\" is scientifically inaccurate because a vacuum is a space devoid of matter and cannot be \"held\" by a bin, whether it is positive or negative. It does not make sense in a practical context.",
        "The choice \"can hold wet octopus parts easily\" aligns with the practical use of a bin as a container to store physical items. Bins are commonly used for storing various materials, including wet items.",
        "Given the practical and realistic alignment of choice B with the function of a bin, it is the correct answer."
