    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct tool for stripping insulation from a cord, consider the function of each tool mentioned in the choices.",
        "First, evaluate the wire stripper. A wire stripper is specifically designed to remove the insulation from electrical wires without damaging the wire itself.",
        "This tool usually has various notches to accommodate different wire sizes and ensures precision in stripping the insulation.",
        "Next, consider the wire cutter. A wire cutter is primarily intended for cutting wires rather than stripping insulation. Using it to remove insulation may damage the wire.",
        "Based on the functions of the tools, the wire stripper is the appropriate tool for the job.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is A: You can use a wire stripper to remove the outer casing."
