    "steps": [
        "When trying to eat less, the visual cues provided by the size of the plate can influence perception of how much food is being consumed.",
        "Larger plates can make portions look smaller than they actually are, potentially leading to overeating because the brain perceives the amount of food to be less.",
        "Smaller plates make portions look larger, which can trick the mind into feeling satisfied with less food because the brain perceives the amount of food to be more.",
