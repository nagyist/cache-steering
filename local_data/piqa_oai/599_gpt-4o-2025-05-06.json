    "question": "how do you put out a fire?\n\nChoices:\nA: throw dirt and water onto the fire to put it out.\nB: throw a large blanket over the fire to cut off the oxygen.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the nature of the fire. Common household fires can be put out using simple methods such as water, dirt, or blankets. Different types of fires may require different approaches. For example, grease fires require special care because using water can cause the fire to spread.",
        "Evaluate the choices provided for putting out the fire:\n1. Throwing dirt and water onto the fire to put it out.\n2. Throwing a large blanket over the fire to cut off the oxygen.",
        "Understand the mechanics of fire suppression. To put out a fire, you need to remove one or more elements of the fire triangle: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Water can reduce the heat and help extinguish the fire effectively. Dirt can cover the fuel and block oxygen.",
        "Consider the safety and effectiveness of the methods:\n- Throwing dirt and water onto the fire is generally safe and effective for most common fires as it cools and smothers the flames.\n- Using a blanket can be effective in cutting off oxygen for small fires but requires the blanket to be fire-resistant and deployed correctly.",
        "Compare the two choices:\n- Choice A: Dirt and water are readily accessible and effective for a range of fire types, making it a practical general solution.\n- Choice B: A blanket can work but is more suitable for specific situations and requires correct usage.",
        "Given the above reasoning, the most straightforward, accessible, and generally effective method for putting out a fire is to throw dirt and water onto the fire.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: throw dirt and water onto the fire to put it out."
