    "question": "To cook diced onions in a frying pan on the stove.\n\nChoices:\nA: Coat the bottom of the pan with 1 1/2 tsp olive oil. Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is a rapid boil. Add the diced onion and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan cover and let cook, stirring occasionally.\nB: Coat the bottom of the pan with 1 1/2 tsp olive oil. Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is simmering. Add the diced onion and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan cover and let cook, stirring occasionally.",
    "steps": [
        "The question asks for the correct procedure for cooking diced onions in a frying pan on the stove. There are two choices provided.",
        "For cooking diced onions, it is important to coat the bottom of the pan with oil to ensure even cooking and prevent sticking. Both choices instruct to coat the pan with 1 1/2 tsp olive oil.",
        "Next, the pan needs to be heated. Choice A suggests heating the oil until it is a rapid boil, while Choice B suggests heating the oil until it is simmering.",
        "Rapidly boiling oil is not necessary and can be dangerous as it may cause the oil to splatter. Simmering oil is more controlled and safe for cooking diced onions, ensuring they do not burn.",
        "The remaining steps in both choices involve adding the diced onion, stirring to coat with oil, spreading the onions out evenly over the pan, and letting them cook while stirring occasionally.",
        "Based on the reasoning, choice B, where the oil is heated until simmering, is the correct and safe method for cooking diced onions."
