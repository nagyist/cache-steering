    "steps": [
        "To determine the best way to remove frost from a car window, we need to consider the effects of different substances on frost.",
        "Windex is primarily a glass cleaner and is not formulated to effectively melt or remove frost. It might help in cleaning once the frost is already melted, but it is not effective in removing frost by itself.",
        "Alcohol, on the other hand, has a much lower freezing point than water. Spraying alcohol on a frosted window can help to more effectively melt the frost because it lowers the freezing point of the frosty layer and causes it to liquefy, making it easier to wipe away.",
        "Therefore, using alcohol is a more effective method for removing frost from a car window compared to using Windex.",
        "Considering the properties of alcohol and its effectiveness in melting frost, the correct answer is B: Spray window with alcohol, then wipe away."
