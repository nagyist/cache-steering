    "question": "To measure a specific distance on a piece of wood, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a compass to measure the needed distance on the wood\nB: Use a square to measure the needed distance on the wood",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the function of a compass and a square. A compass is primarily used for drawing circles or arcs, not for measuring straight distances.",
        "A square, particularly a carpenter's square or a combination square, is specifically designed for measuring and marking straight edges and angles on pieces of wood.",
        "Considering we are measuring a specific distance on a piece of wood, a tool that allows precise straight measurements is necessary.",
        "The square fulfills this requirement, making it the appropriate tool for the task.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Use a square to measure the needed distance on the wood."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
