    "question": "How do I cut circles of equal sizes from tissue paper when making a dotted lantern?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fold tissue paper to several layers, Cut circles  from several layers at a time\nB: Fold tissue paper to several layers, Cut circles  from one layer at a time",
    "steps": [
        "To efficiently cut multiple circles of equal sizes from tissue paper, one must consider methods that maximize time and precision.",
        "Folding the tissue paper into several layers helps in creating multiple identical shapes with single cut actions.",
        "When cutting circles from several layers at a time, it ensures consistency in size and shape, as all layers are guided by the same cut.",
        "Cutting circles from one layer at a time would be inefficient and difficult to ensure that all circles are of equal size.",
        "Thus, folding the tissue paper to several layers and then cutting circles from these layered tissue papers at once is the best approach for making a dotted lantern.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Fold tissue paper to several layers, Cut circles  from several layers at a time."

    "solution": "A"
