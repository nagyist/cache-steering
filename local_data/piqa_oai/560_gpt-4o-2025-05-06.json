    "steps": [
        "To make the best corn on the cob involves boiling corn with specific ingredients that enhance flavor and texture.",
        "First, adding salt helps to season the corn.",
        "Second, adding butter is a common practice as it imparts richness and additional flavor to the corn.",
        "Milk is added to give the corn a tender and creamy texture.",
        "Bringing the water to a rapid boil ensures the corn cooks evenly and swiftly.",
        "Simmering the corn on low heat allows the flavors to combine and integrate well over 10 minutes without overcooking.",
        "Answer choice A adheres to these practices by using traditional ingredients like butter and achieving the desired cooking method.",
        "Answer choice B, on the other hand, includes peanut butter, which is unorthodox and does not complement the flavors typically associated with corn on the cob.",
        "The method of bringing the water to a slow boil in option B is less effective than a rapid boil for cooking corn quickly and evenly.",
        "Therefore, option A is the correct answer for making the best corn on the cob."
