    "question": "How can you tell if a child is a boy or a girl?\n\nChoices:\nA: Bend down and ask the parent, \"What's your name\"?  The child will either answer or the parent will, then you are much more likely to have a good idea.\nB: Bend down and ask the child, \"What's your name\"?  The child will either answer or the parent will, then you are much more likely to have a good idea.",
    "steps": [
        "First, assess the two options given:\nA: Bend down and ask the parent, \"What's your name\"? \nB: Bend down and ask the child, \"What's your name\"?",
        "Option A suggests asking the parent, but this may not directly provide information about the child's gender, as you will only learn the parent's name. The child's gender cannot be inferred from the parent's name.",
        "Option B suggests asking the child directly. By asking the child for their name, you are more likely to get a name that is gender-associated which can help you infer the child's gender.",
        "Therefore, asking the child their name (Option B) is a more direct approach and increases the likelihood of understanding if the child is a boy or a girl.",
        "Conclude that the correct answer is B."
