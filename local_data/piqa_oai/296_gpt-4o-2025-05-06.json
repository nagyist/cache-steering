    "question": "how to DIY a grease trap for a grill\n\nChoices:\nA: place a disposable clambake apron or a homemade one made from heavy-duty foil, on top of an unlit burner under the grates to catch the drippings\nB: place a disposable pie tin or a homemade one made from heavy-duty foil, on top of an unlit burner under the grates to catch the drippings",
    "steps": [
        "First, we identify that the grill will produce grease drippings that need to be caught.",
        "Next, consider what materials can be used to catch these drippings effectively.",
        "Disposable pie tin or homemade tin from heavy-duty foil are suitable for catching drippings due to their shape and ability to contain liquid.",
        "An unlit burner is chosen to place the grease trap on, ensuring it doesn't get damaged or affect the grill's operation.",
        "Comparing A and B, the clambake apron isn\u2019t designed for containing liquids like grease, whereas a pie tin certainly is.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B, which suggests using a disposable pie tin or a homemade one made from heavy-duty foil to catch the drippings."
