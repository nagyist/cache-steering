    "question": "make homemade raisins\n\nChoices:\nA: Blanch grapes by dropping by the bunch in boiling water for 30 seconds, then transferring into a bowl of wine.    Remove stems.    Pat dry with a towel and spread in a single layer onto baking sheets.    Place baking sheet in an oven set to warm (180 degrees is ideal) and allow to dry 18-24 hours, turning after 12 hours to prevent sticking.    Once dark and wrinkled, remove from oven and allow to cool before storing in an airtight container.\nB: Blanch grapes by dropping by the bunch in boiling water for 30 seconds, then transferring into a bowl of ice water.

    "steps": [
        "Blanching is a common technique used to prepare fruits and vegetables for freezing or drying. It involves boiling the item briefly and then shocking it in ice water.",
        "Blanching grapes in boiling water for 30 seconds will help to loosen their skins and kill any surface bacteria.",
        "Transferring the grapes into ice water immediately after boiling stops the cooking process and firms up the grapes, preserving their texture.",
        "Removing stems is an important step to ensure even drying and to prevent any contamination from the stems.",
        "Patting the grapes dry is essential to remove excess water that can slow down the drying process and cause uneven drying.",
        "Placing the grapes in a single layer on baking sheets ensures that they dry evenly and don't stick together.",
        "Setting the oven to warm (180 degrees) is a low-temperature method that helps to dry the grapes slowly without cooking them.",
        "Turning the grapes after 12 hours prevents them from sticking to the baking sheets and ensures that they dry uniformly on all sides.",
        "Once the grapes are dark and wrinkled, they have turned into raisins and should be allowed to cool down before being stored in an airtight container to keep them fresh.",
        "Option B is the correct answer because it specifies the use of ice water, which is a key step in the blanching process for making homemade raisins."
