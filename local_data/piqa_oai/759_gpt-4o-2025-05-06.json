        "To separate an egg using your hands, you need to crack the egg open.",
        "Cracking it on the side of a bowl is a common method to achieve a clean break and avoid making a mess.",
        "Once cracked, you should open the egg shell with one hand over the bowl to keep everything contained and prevent spillage.",
        "You then hold the egg with your other hand underneath, allowing the egg white to drip through your open fingers into the bowl.",
        "This method allows the yolk to stay in your hand while the egg white separates and falls into the bowl.",
        "Cracking the egg over the counter and letting it drip onto the counter, as described in option B, would likely create a mess and is not a practical method.",
