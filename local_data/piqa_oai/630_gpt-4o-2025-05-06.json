    "question": "To make glaze seep down into bread.\n\nChoices:\nA: To make the glaze seep down into the bread a lot, you can poke tiny holes with a spoon before pouring the glaze on.\nB: To make the glaze seep down into the bread a lot, you can poke tiny holes with a tooth pick before pouring the glaze on.",
    "steps": [
        "First, analyze the context of the question, which is about making glaze seep down into bread.",
        "Next, consider the tools mentioned in the choices: a spoon and a toothpick.",
        "A spoon typically has a wider surface area and is less precise for poking tiny holes compared to a toothpick.",
        "A toothpick, on the other hand, has a pointed tip which is more suited for creating small, precise holes in the bread.",
        "Small, precise holes would allow the glaze to seep down more effectively into the bread rather than spread broadly on the surface.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: To make the glaze seep down into the bread a lot, you can poke tiny holes with a tooth pick before pouring the glaze on."

    "solution": "B"
