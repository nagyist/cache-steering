        "To determine the better option for making a mini lamp, we need to consider the practical aspects of lighting and ventilation.",
        "Option A involves creating holes on top of a tin can. The primary issue here is that candle flames require oxygen to keep burning. With holes only on the top, there may not be adequate airflow into the tin can to sustain the flame properly, especially as melted wax can potentially block some of the holes.",
        "Option B involves creating holes in the sides of the tin can, which allows for better airflow. Air can enter through the side holes, supplying oxygen directly to the candle flame. This is more effective in maintaining a steady and strong flame. Additionally, side holes can also project light outwards, which enhances the lamp's function of illuminating the surrounding area.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Create holes in sides of a tin can and place candle in center."
