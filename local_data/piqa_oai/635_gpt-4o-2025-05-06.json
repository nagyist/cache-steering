    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand the basic materials used for making a kite.",
        "Kites typically use lightweight materials for the sail, like plastic or garbage bags, not heavy or rigid materials like garbage pails.",
        "Therefore, the option that suggests using a garbage bag (Option A) is more appropriate than the option suggesting a garbage pail (Option B).",
        "Option A further provides a coherent, step-by-step procedure that is logical and practical for creating a functional kite.",
        "Consequently, the correct answer is Option A."
