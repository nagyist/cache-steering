    "steps": [
        "The goal is to determine the proper method of lighting a grill using potato chips.",
        "Option A explains that potato chips contain oil, which can ignite the charcoal. Ignition refers to starting a fire, which is necessary to cook food on the grill.",
        "Option B uses the term 'install' instead of 'ignite'. 'Install' is not correct in the context of starting a fire.",
        "The correct terminology in the context of lighting a grill would be 'ignite'.",
        "Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it properly describes the process of using the oil in potato chips to ignite the charcoal without lighter fluid."
