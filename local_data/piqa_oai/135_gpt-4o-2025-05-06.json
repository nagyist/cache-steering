    "question": "To prevent cookies from burning.\n\nChoices:\nA: Your baking pans should be light colored rather than dark. Cookies baked on dark pans will tend to burn on the bottom.\nB: Your baking pans should be light colored rather than dark. Cookies baked on dark pans will tend to burn on the top.",
    "steps": [
        "Dark-colored pans absorb more heat and thus can cause the cookies to burn quickly due to increased heat at the bottom.",
        "Light-colored pans reflect heat more efficiently, resulting in a more even and slower baking process.",
        "Cookies baked on dark pans will experience increased bottom heat, leading to potential burning on the bottom.",
        "Therefore, to prevent cookies from burning, light-colored pans should be used since they help distribute heat more evenly and avoid excess bottom heat.",
        "Considering all the given choices, the most accurate option is A because it specifically addresses the increased heat absorption by dark pans and its effects on the bottom of the cookies."

    "solution": "A"
