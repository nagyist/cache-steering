        "First, we need to identify the cleaning agents mentioned in both options. This includes Baking soda in option A and Baking powder in option B.",
        "Baking soda is a common cleaning agent known for its ability to remove stains and odors, while Baking powder is generally used for baking and does not have the same cleaning properties.",
        "Therefore, for cleaning purposes, Baking soda is more appropriate than Baking powder, which makes option A the correct choice.",
        "Next, both options suggest a mixture of Baking soda/powder with laundry detergent and toothpaste, then applying the mixture using a toothbrush. However, as previously established, Baking soda is the correct ingredient for cleaning.",
        "Option A correctly includes all necessary cleaning agents: Baking soda, toothpaste, laundry detergent, a toothbrush, and a cup. We need to ensure the correct combination and application for cleaning shoes.",
        "Thus, the valid process for cleaning shoes using Baking soda is detailed correctly in option A.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is option A: You need Baking soda, toothpaste, laundry detergent, a toothbrush and a cup. Mix baking soda with laundry detergent into a cup until it forms a nice loose paste. You should try to have a 1:2 ratio of soda to detergent, but as long as the consistency is right, you should be okay. After everything is incorporated, add the toothpaste and mix. Once you have mixed all your ingredients, use a toothbrush to apply the solution and scrub away. Make sure to remove the laces first. Allow the mixture to dry and once it dries, wash it off using the toothbrush again. Allow your sneakers to dry."
