    "question": "Make a secure password for smartphone.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use capital letters for extra security.\nB: Use accented letters for extra security.",
    "steps": [
        "To create a secure password, it's important to incorporate complexity and unpredictability into its composition.",
        "Capital letters add complexity to a password by increasing the variety of characters used, but they are common and predictable choices.",
        "Accented letters, on the other hand, are less frequently used in passwords and add an additional layer of complexity and unpredictability.",
        "Accented letters can make it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack the password, thus enhancing security more effectively.",
        "Therefore, using accented letters for extra security is considered a better choice than using capital letters."
