        "First, understand the basic function of a walker. Walkers are designed to provide support and stability while walking, especially for individuals with mobility issues.",
        "Next, consider the design of a typical walker. It usually consists of a lightweight frame with four legs that need to be kept stable to provide proper support.",
        "Review the choices given. Choice A suggests pushing the walker in front and leaning on it, while Choice B suggests pulling the walker behind and leaning back.",
        "Think about the practicality and stability of each choice. Pushing the walker in front (Choice A) allows you to keep your body upright and maintain forward momentum safely, using the walker as a stable base.",
        "Pulling the walker behind you (Choice B) would compromise stability, as it would not be positioned to provide adequate support, and leaning back could increase the risk of falling.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is the option that ensures stability and safe movement, which is Choice A: push it in front of you and lean on it with each step you take."
