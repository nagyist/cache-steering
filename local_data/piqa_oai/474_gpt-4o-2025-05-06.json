    "steps": [
        "First, analyze the purpose of mascara. Mascara is used to enhance the appearance of the eyelashes, making them longer, thicker, and more defined.",
        "Next, consider the action mentioned in each choice. For Choice A, rubbing the mascara wand against your lips does not serve the purpose of applying mascara to eyelashes.",
        "For Choice B, rubbing the mascara wand against your lashes directly applies the mascara to the eyelashes, achieving the intended effect.",
        "Additionally, looking upwards is a common technique used to easily access the lower lashes while avoiding transfer to the skin below the eyes.",
        "Therefore, combining these steps makes Choice B the more logical and correct method for applying mascara.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: look upwards and rub the mascara wand against your lashes to transfer color."
