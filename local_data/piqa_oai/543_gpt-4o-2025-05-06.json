        "Next, we evaluate the two options provided: \"can make be used as a musical instrument\" and \"can make be used as a musical tuner.\"",
        "The term \"musical instrument\" refers to devices that produce sound for music, such as guitars, pianos, or flutes.",
        "The term \"musical tuner\" refers to devices that help tune musical instruments to the correct pitch.",
        "Considering the characteristics of a jug, we know that blowing across the top of a jug can produce sound. This sound can be used to create music, sometimes referred to as jug band music.",
