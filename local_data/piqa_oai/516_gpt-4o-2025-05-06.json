    "question": "What should I do once the copper pipe solder has cooled down when working on a plumbing project?\n\nChoices:\nA: grab a rag and wipe the excess flux off as good measure and test your joints by turning the water back off.\nB: grab a rag and wipe the excess flux off as good measure and test your joints by turning the water back on.",
    "steps": [
        "When working with copper pipes and solder in a plumbing project, it is essential to ensure that the connections are properly sealed and there are no leaks.",
        "Once the solder has cooled down, excess flux should be wiped off because it can be corrosive and potentially damage the pipe over time.",
        "After cleaning off the excess flux, the next step is to test the joints to ensure that the soldering has created a watertight seal.",
        "To test the joints, you should turn the water supply back on and check for any leaks or issues with the connections.",
        "Therefore, the correct procedure would be to wipe the excess flux off and then turn the water back on to test the joints."
