        "To check if a child has a fever, one needs to measure their body temperature accurately.",
        "The common method to measure body temperature is using a thermometer.",
        "The correct places to insert a thermometer to get an accurate body temperature reading are the mouth, under the armpit, or possibly other locations like the rectum or ear, but the mouth and armpit are most straightforward for home use.",
        "Holding a thermometer in the hand or between toes does not provide an accurate measure of core body temperature.",
        "A fever is typically indicated when the thermometer reads anything above 99 degrees Fahrenheit.",
