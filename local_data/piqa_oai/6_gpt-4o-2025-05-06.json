Once frozen, take it out and put it in a ziploc bag. You can now use it as an ice pack.\nB: take a sponge and soak it in water. Put the sponge in a refrigerator and let it freeze. Once frozen, take it out and put it in a ziploc bag. You can now use it as an ice pack.",
    "steps": [
        "Creating an ice pack requires a substance that can freeze and remain cold for a period.",
        "Sponge can absorb liquids, making it suitable for creating a makeshift ice pack if used with an appropriate liquid.",
        "Oil does not freeze well at typical household freezer temperatures, which makes it unsuitable for ice pack creation.",
        "Water, on the other hand, freezes at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), making it a suitable liquid for an ice pack.",
        "To make a makeshift ice pack, soaking a sponge in water and freezing it will create an object that holds cold temperatures and can be used to reduce swelling or pain.",
        "Ensuring that the sponge is placed in a ziploc bag helps contain any melting water and keeps the surroundings dry.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: take a sponge and soak it in water. Put the sponge in a refrigerator and let it freeze. Once frozen, take it out and put it in a ziploc bag. You can now use it as an ice pack."
