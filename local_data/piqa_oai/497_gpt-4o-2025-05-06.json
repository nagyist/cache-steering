    "question": "To prevent a potato from drying out while baking it,\n\nChoices:\nA: wrap the potato in foil and poke holes into it before wrapping it.\nB: place the potato on the rack and let the potato steam itself on a low heat.",
    "steps": [
        "To prevent food from drying out during baking, we typically use methods to trap moisture.",
        "Wrapping a potato in foil helps keep the moisture inside, preventing it from drying out.",
        "Poking holes into the potato before wrapping it allows steam to escape, reducing the risk of the potato bursting while baking.",
        "Placing the potato on the rack without wrapping it does not trap moisture, increasing the risk of the potato drying out.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is to wrap the potato in foil and poke holes into it before wrapping it, as this method helps prevent the potato from drying out while baking."
