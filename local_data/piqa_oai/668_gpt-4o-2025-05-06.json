    "question": "To make a wooden table water resistant for a short time,\n\nChoices:\nA: coat the wood in bees wax before it is covered with water.\nB: put a small tarp under the table to catch any runoff water.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the objective: making a wooden table water resistant for a short time.",
        "Evaluate Choice A: Coating the wood in bees wax creates a protective barrier that prevents water from seeping into the wood, thus making it water resistant.",
        "Evaluate Choice B: Putting a small tarp under the table catches runoff water, but it does not make the table itself water resistant. The wood remains unprotected and susceptible to water damage.",
        "Since Choice A directly addresses the need to make the wood itself water resistant, while Choice B does not, Choice A is the correct answer."
