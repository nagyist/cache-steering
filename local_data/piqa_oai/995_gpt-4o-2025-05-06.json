    "question": "Soften butter quickly.\n\nChoices:\nA: Microwave a glass of milk, pour milk out, then place glass on top of butter.\nB: Microwave a glass of water, pour water out, then place glass on top of butter.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the goal which is to soften butter quickly.",
        "Next, analyze the options: \nOption A suggests microwaving a glass of milk. Milk can scald or form skin when heated, complicating the process. Also, the residual milk could create a mess or alter the butter\u2019s consistency.",
        "Option B suggests microwaving a glass of water. Water heats evenly and generates steam, which could effectively warm the glass. Additionally, water leaves no residue that could affect the butter.",
        "After pouring out either liquid (milk or water), the warm glass is placed over the butter. The residual heat from the glass will help soften the butter.",
        "Since water is simpler and cleaner to handle after microwaving, it helps in applying consistent heat to the butter without any mess.",
        "Therefore, option B is the more effective and convenient choice for softening butter quickly."
