        "Consider the purpose of the garage parking aid, which is to help the driver know when the car is too close to a certain point in the garage.",
        "Examine the properties of the objects mentioned in the choices: a tennis ball and a bowling ball.",
        "A tennis ball is relatively light and soft, so if it contacts a car, it is unlikely to cause damage or scratches.",
