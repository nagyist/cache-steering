    "question": "sleeve\n\nChoices:\nA: is made of cloth just like a wok and covers the body\nB: is made of cloth just like a blanket and covers the body",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the first choice: A suggests that a sleeve is made of cloth just like a wok. A wok is typically made of metal, not cloth.",
        "This makes the comparison illogical because a sleeve is indeed made of cloth, so comparing it to a wok doesn't make sense.",
        "Now consider the second choice: B suggests that a sleeve is made of cloth just like a blanket. A blanket is usually made of cloth.",
        "This comparison is logical because both a sleeve and a blanket are made of cloth and can cover parts of the body.",
        "Therefore, the most logical and correct answer is B: is made of cloth just like a blanket and covers the body."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
