    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct tool for crosscutting pieces of wood to a specific size, we need to consider the capabilities of each tool mentioned.",
        "A hand held razor blade is designed for cutting through softer materials like paper, cardboard, or thin plastic. It is not capable of effectively cutting through wood, which is much harder.",
        "On the other hand, a hand held circular saw is specifically designed for cutting through wood and other similar materials. It has a rotating blade that can make precise, clean cuts through wood.",
        "Given the need to cross cut pieces of wood to a specific size, the tool must be able to make precise and clean cuts through the wood.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice for cleanly separating wood is the hand held circular saw.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Use a hand held circular saw to cleanly separate the wood."

    "solution": "B"
