    "steps": [
        "To deice your windshield, you need to use a method that effectively removes ice without damaging the glass or being inconvenient.",
        "The correct option involves placing a thick cloth on the windshield and pouring commercial de-icer onto it. This allows the de-icer to soak and begin melting the ice.",
        "Allowing it to sit for five to ten minutes ensures the chemical has time to react with the ice.",
        "After checking that the ice is melting, you need to scrape off the ice. Using fingernails can be potentially damaging and inefficient.",
        "Using an ice scraper is safe, effective, and designed for this purpose.",
        "Storing the cloth for future use or disposal keeps the process clean and manageable.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is to use an ice scraper as it is more practical and safe than fingernails.",
        "Hence, the correct choice is B."
