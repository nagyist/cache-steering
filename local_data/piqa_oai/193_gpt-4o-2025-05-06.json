    "question": "computer\n\nChoices:\nA: sets my alarm Bridges breaks down constantly.\nB: sets my alarm My Car breaks down constantly.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we examine the question \"computer\" and note that the term 'computer' is singular and neutral, it does not inherently indicate any personal or possessive sense. The term itself isn't sufficient to directly suggest the correct answer.",
        "Next, we examine Option A: \"sets my alarm Bridges breaks down constantly.\" and note that 'Bridges' in this context does not logically fit as something related to a computer and 'sets my alarm.' Furthermore, 'sets my alarm' and 'Bridges breaks down constantly' are disjoint and make the statement incoherent.",
        "Then, we examine Option B: \"sets my alarm My Car breaks down constantly.\" and note that while \"sets my alarm\" and \"My Car breaks down constantly.\" could be seen as separate ideas, they form a more coherent and logical statement when considering additional context or thematic relevance.",
        "Option B's structure allows us to read the sentence as two statements that, while separate, are possible comments someone might make consecutively about different common technical problems (one with a digital assistant or computer setting an alarm, another with an automobile). Although not a perfect fit, it makes more contextual sense compared to Option A.",
        "Therefore, the most coherent and contextually appropriate answer is Option B, \"sets my alarm My Car breaks down constantly.\""

    "solution": "B"
