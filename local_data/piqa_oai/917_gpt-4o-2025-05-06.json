    "question": "In order to start a fire,\n\nChoices:\nA: use a collection of flammable debris and papers, add some washer fluid, then touch with an open flame.\nB: use a collection of flammable debris and papers, add some lighter fluid, then touch with an open flame.",
    "steps": [
        "First, let's consider the materials needed to start a fire safely and effectively. Flammable debris and papers are commonly used as kindling because they catch fire easily.",
        "Next, we need to add a liquid that will help ignite the fire. Lighter fluid is designed specifically for starting fires because it is highly flammable and creates a controlled flame when ignited.",
        "On the other hand, washer fluid is not designed for this purpose. Washer fluid typically contains water and alcohol or other detergents, which are not suitable for starting fires and can actually prevent the fire from igniting.",
        "Finally, once the appropriate materials are collected and the lighter fluid is added, an open flame can be used to ignite the kindling.",
        "Considering the purpose and composition of the fluids mentioned, the correct choice for safely starting a fire is adding lighter fluid to the flammable debris and papers, then touching it with an open flame.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: use a collection of flammable debris and papers, add some lighter fluid, then touch with an open flame."
