Move the tongs so that the heads are positioned on either side of the biscuit. Gently squeeze the handles until the biscuit is held between the two heads.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the function and components of tongs. Tongs are a tool with two hinged arms used to grasp objects.",
        "Next, determine which part of the tongs is used to hold objects. The tongs have handles for holding and heads for grasping objects.",
        "Then, analyze the steps given in the choices. In choice A, the instruction is to grasp the head of the tongs which is incorrect for proper use as it is meant for grasping the object, not holding.",
        "Choice B instructs to grasp the handles of the tongs, which is correct because the handles allow you to control the tongs.",
        "Lastly, choice B mentions positioning the heads on either side of the biscuit and squeezing the handles until the biscuit is held between the heads, which accurately describes the correct usage of tongs."
