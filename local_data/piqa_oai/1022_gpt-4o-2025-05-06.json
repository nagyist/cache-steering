    "question": "To get the edges of pie crust to stick together.\n\nChoices:\nA: Brush one half of the pie crust disc with water before folding, then crimp with a fork.\nB: Brush one half of the pie crust disc with water before folding, then crimp with a spatula.",
    "steps": [
        "First, examine the purpose of getting the edges of a pie crust to stick together. The water helps to hold the two surfaces together by creating a bit of glue-like consistency.",
        "Next, consider the method of crimping, which is essential to ensure the edges of the pie crust stay together. The usual kitchen tools for crimping pie crusts include forks and similar utensils.",
        "Option A suggests brushing one half with water, then crimping with a fork. Using a fork to crimp pie crust edges is a common and effective method because the fork tines apply pressure and create a tight seal.",
        "Option B suggests crimping with a spatula. A spatula typically has a flat, broad surface which is not well-suited for crimping the dough effectively. The broad surface is less likely to create a strong seal compared to a fork.",
        "Based on the effectiveness of the tools mentioned, the correct answer is A, which combines water and using a fork for a solid crimp."
