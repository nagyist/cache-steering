    "question": "How to play hockey in Mars?\n\nChoices:\nA: One can't play hockey in there due to lack of gravity.\nB: Use heavy weight pucks and sticks.",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand what conditions are required to play hockey on Earth. These include gravity, friction on the ice to move the puck, atmospheric pressure for breathing, and appropriate temperature for maintaining ice.",
        "Mars has gravity, but it's only about 38% of Earth's gravity, which significantly affects the dynamics of the game and would make it challenging to control the puck and maintain balance.",
        "Martian temperatures average around -80 degrees Fahrenheit, with extremes that can drop much lower. While cold temperatures can create ice, maintaining a rink surface would still be difficult.",
        "Another critical factor is that Mars lacks a stable atmosphere. The air pressure is less than 1% of Earth's, which would complicate breathing without specialized suits and equipment.",
        "Options provided are:\nA: One can't play hockey in there due to lack of gravity.\nB: Use heavy weight pucks and sticks.",
        "Since the gravity on Mars is much lower than Earth's and it affects key aspects of playing hockey like puck movement and player stability, option A correctly identifies a fundamental problem with playing hockey on Mars.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: One can't play hockey in there due to lack of gravity."
