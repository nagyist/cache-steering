    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, first note that the original question is asking if one can blend their own peppermint tea. The correct answer should provide detailed instructions on how to do so.",
        "Next, analyze both choices to identify which one gives a feasible and realistic amount of peppermint for making tea. Choice A suggests using 1 half cup of peppermint extract, which is an unusually large amount for a single cup of tea.",
        "On the other hand, Choice B suggests using 1 teaspoon of peppermint, which is a typical and reasonable amount for making tea, especially in comparison to other common home-brew recipes for herbal teas.",
        "Both choices include fennel seeds and coriander seeds in the same quantities and provide the same steeping instructions, making the quantity of peppermint the deciding factor.",
        "Thus, considering normal tea blending practices, Choice B correctly delineates the proper quantity of peppermint along with the fennel and coriander seeds per cup of tea, and aligns with common practice. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
