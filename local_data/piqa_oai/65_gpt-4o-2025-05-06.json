        "To determine the correct method for unclogging a toilet without a plunger, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of the substances mentioned in the choices.",
        "Choice A recommends using baking soda and drywall mud. Baking soda can help in loosening clogs due to its abrasive nature and chemical properties. However, drywall mud is not typically used for unclogging drains and may, in fact, worsen the clog.",
        "Choice B recommends using baking soda and vinegar. Baking soda is effective for loosening clogs due to its abrasive nature, and vinegar interacts with baking soda causing a fizzy reaction. This chemical reaction can help break down the clog and clear the blockage.",
        "Based on the common use of both baking soda and vinegar as natural cleaning agents, and the chemical reaction they produce, Choice B seems to be the more effective method for unclogging a toilet without a plunger.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Pour 1 cup baking soda and 2 cups vinegar into the toilet. Allow it to fizz for a half hour. If the clog doesn't dissipate, try the hot water trick to unclog a toilet without a plunger."
