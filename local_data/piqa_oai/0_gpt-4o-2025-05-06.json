    "question": "When boiling butter, when it's ready, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Pour it onto a plate\nB: Pour it into a jar",
    "steps": [
        "Boiling butter typically involves melting it, which is commonly done to clarify it. Clarified butter is often stored for future use.",
        "Once the butter is boiled and clarified, it needs to be stored in a container that can preserve its quality.",
        "Pouring the clarified butter into a jar is a practical way to store it, as jars can be sealed and protect the contents from contamination.",
        "Pouring the butter onto a plate does not provide a means for long-term storage, and it might solidify and be harder to transfer to another container later.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Pour it into a jar."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
