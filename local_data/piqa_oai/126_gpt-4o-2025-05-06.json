    "steps": [
        "To clean car windows, using a glass cleaner like Windex is a common method.",
        "Cleaning often involves spraying the cleaner on the windows to dissolve dirt and grime.",
        "Leaving the cleaner for a few hours could allow it to do a deeper clean, although this is not typically required and might overstate the recommended wait time.",
        "Using windscreen wipers to remove the cleaner from the windows would be effective in cleaning the windows.",
        "Answer A mentions running the windscreen wipers, which is practical as windscreen wipers are specifically designed for cleaning the front and rear windows.",
        "Answer B suggests running some water on the windows, which is less effective as it may not remove the cleaner residue thoroughly.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Spray some windex on the windows and leave it for a few hours, then when you enter the car again run the windscreen wipers."
