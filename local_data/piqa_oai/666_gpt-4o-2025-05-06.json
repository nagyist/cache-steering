    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand the function and characteristics of a blanket.",
        "A blanket is typically a large piece of fabric that is used to keep warm, cover things, or wrap around something.",
        "Next, we need to consider the choices provided and their relevance to what a blanket can do.",
        "Choice A suggests that a blanket can cut socks. Blankets are not designed to cut anything because they are made of soft material.",
        "Choice B suggests that a blanket can wrap socks. Since a blanket can wrap around things and keep them covered, it is perfectly reasonable to say that a blanket can wrap socks.",
        "After comparing the two choices, it is clear that choice B accurately describes a function that a blanket can perform.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: can wrap socks."
