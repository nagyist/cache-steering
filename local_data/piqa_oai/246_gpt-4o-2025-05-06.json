    "question": "What is the most energy efficient way to cool your car if you are driving over 40 mph?\n\nChoices:\nA: Leaving the windows closed and turning your Air conditioner on is cheaper.\nB: Leaving the windows closed and turning your heater on is cheaper.",
    "steps": [
        "When driving at higher speeds, wind resistance increases as air flows into the car with open windows.",
        "Increased wind resistance causes the car's engine to work harder, leading to higher fuel consumption.",
        "Using the air conditioner consumes energy but is more efficient at higher speeds compared to the extra drag caused by open windows.",
        "The heaters generally produce heat rather than cool air, making them ineffective for cooling purposes.",
        "Therefore, at speeds over 40 mph, it is more energy efficient to keep windows closed and use the air conditioner."
