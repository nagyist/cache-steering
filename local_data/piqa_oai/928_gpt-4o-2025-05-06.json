Open bag and put all of your dough inside. Leave unsealed, then vigorously shake until cinnamon sugar evenly coats all the pieces of dough.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we should understand what \"monkey bread\" is and the general process of coating dough pieces to make it.",
        "Monkey bread is a sweet, sticky, pull-apart bread typically made from pieces of dough coated in cinnamon sugar. The dough pieces need to be evenly coated in the mixture to ensure the bread has a uniform taste and texture.",
        "Next, we will examine the provided choices to see which one fits best with the need to evenly coat the dough pieces in cinnamon sugar.",
        "Choice A involves sealing the bag after adding the dough pieces, then shaking it vigorously. Sealing the bag ensures that the dough pieces won't fall out and creates a better environment for evenly coating the dough without making a mess.",
        "Choice B involves leaving the bag unsealed while shaking. This method risks the dough pieces falling out, and sugar and cinnamon spreading everywhere, making it less efficient and messier.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A as it achieves the goal of evenly coating the dough pieces in a controlled and efficient manner."
