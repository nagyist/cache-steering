    "steps": [
        "Evaluate the task: The task is to completely empty an ash tray.",
        "Consider the tools and actions involved: You need to pick up the ash tray, tilt it to empty its contents, shake to remove smaller contents, and then perform a final action.",
        "Examine choice A: Choice A involves picking up the ash tray, tilting it to empty into a container, shaking out smaller contents, and finally dropping the ash tray into the container.",
        "Examine choice B: Choice B involves picking up the ash tray, tilting it to empty into a container, shaking out smaller contents, and finally setting it back down.",
        "Determine logical final steps: Dropping the ash tray into the trash can (option A) is typically unnecessary unless the ash tray itself is disposable or you no longer need it. Setting it back down (option B) is a logical final step for a reusable item.",
        "Consistency with common practice: Most common practice when emptying a reusable ash tray is to set it back down after cleaning, not discard it.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Pick up the ash tray and tilt it so that it empties into the desired container, such as a trash can. Shake it out to remove some of the smaller contents, then set it back down."
