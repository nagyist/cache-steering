        "To assess which option correctly describes the process for making fries, it is necessary to identify the proper cooking instructions.",
        "Baking potatoes requires a source of heat. The relevant tool here is an oven.",

        "Option A goes on to describe mixing ingredients and baking the potatoes for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.",
        "Option B also mentions preheating to the same temperature and includes similar mixing of ingredients.",
