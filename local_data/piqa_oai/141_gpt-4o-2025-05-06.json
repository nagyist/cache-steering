    "steps": [
        "First, consider the general knowledge that toothpaste can act as a mild abrasive cleaner. It is commonly used in household stains removal.",
        "Given the materials involved - wood furniture or walls - an abrasive but gentle cleaner is necessary to avoid damage.",
        "Toothpaste typically contains mild abrasive ingredients, which help scrub away the marker without harming the wood.",
        "Furthermore, hot water helps in rinsing and removing residue efficiently, making it a practical approach.",
        "Alternatively, examine the vinegar option. Vinegar is a mild acid and a natural cleaner but heating it may not necessarily improve its cleaning action and could damage the surface further.",
        "Thus, the combination of toothpaste and hot water presents a balanced and effective solution for removing permanent marker from delicate surfaces like wood furniture or walls.",
        "The correct choice, therefore, is: A: apply toothpaste and then wipe it off with hot water."
