    "question": "How can I apply eyebrow wax?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use wooden toothpicks.\nB: Use wooden craft sticks.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider what eyebrow wax is and its typical application process. Eyebrow wax is a product used to shape and groom eyebrows, often used in beauty treatments.",
        "Next, think about the tools that are typically used for applying wax. Common tools include applicators that can spread the wax evenly and precisely over the eyebrow area.",
        "Option A suggests using wooden toothpicks. Toothpicks are very small, thin, and generally sharp, making them impractical for spreading wax smoothly. They don't offer the necessary surface area to apply the wax effectively.",
        "Option B suggests using wooden craft sticks. Craft sticks are larger and have a flat surface, which makes them more suitable for spreading wax evenly over a larger area, such as the eyebrows.",
        "Therefore, based on the practicality and suitability of the tools for applying eyebrow wax, the best choice is B: Use wooden craft sticks."
