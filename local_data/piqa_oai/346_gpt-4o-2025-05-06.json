    "steps": [
        "First, let's clarify what each option entails. Option A suggests a sock can hold some water that's unfrozen, while option B suggests a sock can hold some jello that's unfrozen.",
        "Next, consider the properties of water and jello. Water is a liquid and would likely pass through the fabric weave of a sock, making it difficult for the sock to hold unfrozen water.",
        "In contrast, jello is a semi-solid substance and would not easily pass through the fabric weave of the sock. Therefore, a sock could hold some jello that's unfrozen more effectively than it could hold water.",
        "Given these considerations, the correct answer is B: a sock can hold some jello that's unfrozen."
