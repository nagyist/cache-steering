        "To answer this question, we need to break down the process of cleaning kitchen cabinet doors. First, we'll examine the ingredients used in the cleaning solution. Vegetable oil and baking soda are known to be effective in removing grime and providing a shine.",
        "Next, we'll consider the application method. Using a paste made of vegetable oil and baking soda applied with a toothbrush will help scrub away grime effectively from the cabinet doors.",
        "Finally, we need to determine the best way to remove the residue. Using a wet cloth would potentially remove the shine that the vegetable oil leaves on the cabinet doors because water can dilute and wash away the oil. On the other hand, using a dry cloth will help remove the baking soda residue while keeping the shine intact.",
        "Therefore, the correct method involves using a dry cloth to remove residue without taking off the shine, making option B the correct answer."
