    "steps": [
        "To make something look like a spider, it usually involves creating legs.",
        "Spiders typically have eight legs.",
        "If you make four pretzel stick pieces stick out of either side, you will have a total of eight legs.",
        "This leg arrangement will resemble a spider.",
        "On the other hand, sticking M&M candies along the edges of the cookie wouldn't resemble a spider.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is A: make four pretzel stick pieces stick out of either side."
