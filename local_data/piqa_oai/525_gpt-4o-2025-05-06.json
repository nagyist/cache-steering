    "question": "How do I garnish my baked pears after they are done baking?\n\nChoices:\nA: Plate the pears, add a scoop of ice cubes, and drizzle with the sauce leftover from the cooking dish\nB: Plate the pears, add a scoop of ice cream, and drizzle with the sauce leftover from the cooking dish",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the common and popular garnishes for baked desserts. Ice cream is a typical garnish that complements the warm, baked pears well.",
        "Second, think about the presentation and taste. Ice cream adds creaminess and balances the sweetness of the pears.",
        "Third, review the choices. While ice cubes could cool the pears, they would dilute the flavors and are not a typical garnish for baked desserts.",
        "Finally, conclude that choice B is the most appropriate garnish that enhances the baked pears without diminishing their taste.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Plate the pears, add a scoop of ice cream, and drizzle with the sauce leftover from the cooking dish."
