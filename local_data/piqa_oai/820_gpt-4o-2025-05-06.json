    "question": "In order to shape wire to make designs,\n\nChoices:\nA: grip the wire between a pair of pliers, then use your fingers to shape the loose part.\nB: grip the wire between a pair of scissors, then use your fingers to shape the loose part.",
    "steps": [
        "To shape wire for making designs, one needs a tool that can securely hold and manipulate the wire.",
        "Pliers are designed for gripping and holding objects securely. They provide a firm grip and can easily be used to shape wire.",
        "Scissors, on the other hand, are designed for cutting and may not provide a secure grip for shaping wire. They are more suited to cutting rather than holding and shaping.",
        "Therefore, using pliers to grip the wire while using fingers to shape the loose part is more appropriate and effective than using scissors.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: grip the wire between a pair of pliers, then use your fingers to shape the loose part."
