    "steps": [
        "Indentation refers to the act of adding space at the beginning of a line to separate paragraphs or sections within a document.",
        "To achieve indentation, you typically start a new paragraph and leave a specific amount of space before beginning the first word. This space is usually equivalent to a tab character or a specified number of spaces.",
        "The option 'A: leave a space before starting the writing' accurately describes the act of indentation. By leaving a space, you create a visual separation that makes paragraphs and sections more distinguishable.",
        "The option 'B: press the spacebar' can be misleading because pressing the spacebar once does not provide enough space for proper indentation. It usually requires pressing the spacebar multiple times or using a tab key to achieve the appropriate indentation.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: leave a space before starting the writing."
