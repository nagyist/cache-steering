    "question": "How can I cut leather with a nice smooth edge?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a steak knife.\nB: Use a razor blade.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the tools available for cutting leather, which are a steak knife and a razor blade.",
        "A steak knife is generally used for cutting meat and has a serrated edge, which would likely create a rough and uneven cut on the leather.",
        "A razor blade, on the other hand, is very sharp and has a smooth edge. It is designed to make precise, clean cuts.",
        "When aiming for a smooth edge on leather, a tool that can make a precise cut without causing roughness or tearing is required.",
        "Given that a razor blade provides a smoother and more precise cut compared to the serrated edge of a steak knife, it is the better option for cutting leather with a nice smooth edge.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Use a razor blade."
