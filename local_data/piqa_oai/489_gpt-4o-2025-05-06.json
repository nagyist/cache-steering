    "question": "Make a rice heating pad.\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut bed sheet into a pouch, fill with cooked rice and sew.\nB: Cut bed sheet into a pouch, fill with dry rice and sew.",
    "steps": [
        "To make a heating pad, we need a material that can retain heat. Rice is commonly used for this purpose because it can absorb and retain heat for a decent amount of time.",
        "The heating pad needs to be able to be warmed repeatedly. Filling the pad with cooked rice would not be suitable because cooked rice has high moisture content which can lead to mold and spoilage over time when repeatedly heated. Dry rice is better because it is low in moisture and less likely to spoil.",
        "The pouch needs to be durable and securely contain the rice. Cutting a bed sheet into a pouch and filling it with dry rice ensures that the rice is evenly distributed and contained without risk of leakage.",
        "Once the pouch is filled with dry rice, sewing it up securely will keep the rice in place and create a functional heating pad that can be used multiple times.",
        "Choice B: Cut bed sheet into a pouch, fill with dry rice and sew, is the correct and practical choice for making a rice heating pad."
