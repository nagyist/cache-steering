    "steps": [
        "When gummy bears are soaked in juice, they tend to stick together due to the moisture and sugar content.",
        "If you take the gummy bears out and place them on a baking sheet to dry, the drying process might cause them to become harder and sticky.",
        "On the other hand, stirring the container twice a day helps to ensure the gummy bears do not stick together as it redistributes the juice and prevents clumping.",
        "Therefore, to prevent sticking in juice-soaked gummy bears, stirring the container twice a day is the more effective method."
