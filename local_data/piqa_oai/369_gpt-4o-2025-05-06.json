        "Understand what a u-turn involves. It is a maneuver to reverse the direction of a vehicle by turning it around.",

        "Choice A suggests turning the car in a complete circle, which would eventually bring the vehicle back to its original direction rather than changing to the opposite direction.",
        "Choice B states turning the car to go in the opposite direction of where you were going, which correctly describes the objective of a u-turn.",
