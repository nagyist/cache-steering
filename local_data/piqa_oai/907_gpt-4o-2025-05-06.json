        "To determine the correct tool for rounding off edges of wooden slats, we need to understand the function and suitability of each tool listed in the choices.",
        "A nail file is a small, handheld tool used primarily for smoothing and shaping fingernails. It is designed for delicate tasks and is unsuitable for working on wooden slats, particularly for rounding off edges due to its small size and limited abrasiveness.",
        "A router, on the other hand, is a power tool commonly used in woodworking to hollow out an area in the surface of a piece of wood or for edge profiling. It is highly effective for rounding off edges with precision and speed, making it the ideal tool for this task.",
        "Considering the purpose of the router and its common use in woodworking for edge finishing, we can conclude that the correct choice is to use a router.",
