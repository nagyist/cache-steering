    "question": "how do you hold breasts in place under a top?\n\nChoices:\nA: wear a tank top\nB: wear a bra.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the function of holding breasts in place and providing support and shape, which typically requires more structure than a tank top can offer.",
        "Understand that a bra is specifically designed to provide the necessary support for the breasts, minimizing movement and maintaining the desired shape under clothing.",
        "Compare this function to that of a tank top, which generally lacks the structural support necessary for holding breasts in place firmly.",
        "Recognize that a bra offers adjustable features like straps and clasps, which enhance support and comfort, whereas a tank top does not.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice for holding breasts in place under a top is to wear a bra.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: wear a bra."
