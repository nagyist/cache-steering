    "steps": [
        "To determine what makes something a carnivore, we need to understand the definition of the term 'carnivore'.",
        "The term 'carnivore' comes from Latin where 'carni' means flesh or meat and 'vorare' means to devour or eat.",
        "Based on the etymology, a carnivore is an organism that primarily consumes meat.",
        "Evaluating the given choices:\nA: 'they eat only plants' - This describes a herbivore, not a carnivore.\nB: 'they eat only meat' - This correctly describes a carnivore.",
        "Therefore, the choice that correctly defines a carnivore is option B: they eat only meat."
