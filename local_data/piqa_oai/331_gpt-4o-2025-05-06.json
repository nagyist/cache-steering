    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, we need to evaluate the accuracy and logic of each choice based on the likely marketing strategy used by Redbox for promotional discounts.",
        "Choice A: If you put one movie in your cart and then add another movie before proceeding to checkout, there is no clear indication that Redbox will provide a discount for the second movie under this scenario.",
        "Choice B: If you put two movies in your cart, then remove one, it creates a scenario where it appears you are not fully committed to renting both movies. Redbox may then offer a discount to incentivize you to keep the second movie in your cart.",
        "This aligns with common marketing tactics where companies offer last-minute discounts to prevent cart abandonment and encourage customers to complete the purchase.",
        "Therefore, Choice B is more likely to result in a discount from Redbox."
