    "steps": [
        "Start by considering the structure of a strawberry. The hull and the white center are generally located at the top of the strawberry where the green leaves are attached.",
        "If you want to remove the hull and the white center efficiently, you need to push through a part of the strawberry that is not obstructed by the leaves.",
        "If you push the straw from the bottom, it will travel through the entire fruit without being obstructed until it reaches the top, where the hull and white center are located.",
        "Pushing the straw from the bottom allows it to push the hull and white center out of the top end effectively.",
        "Pushing the straw through the side could damage more of the fruit and might not consistently remove the hull and white center cleanly."
