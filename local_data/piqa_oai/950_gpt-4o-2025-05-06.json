    "steps": [
        "Consider the physical properties of both a water bottle and reading glasses.",
        "A water bottle is typically made of plastic or metal, materials that are harder and more durable than the glass or plastic used in reading glasses.",
        "If a water bottle is dropped or pressed against reading glasses with force, it can create enough impact to cause the fragile reading glasses to break.",
        "On the other hand, the cost comparison between a water bottle and reading glasses doesn't necessarily align. Reading glasses can vary widely in price depending on the brand, prescription, and quality.",
        "Given these considerations, the property \"can break reading glasses\" (A) is more likely and logically accurate compared to a water bottle being \"as expensive as reading glasses\" (B).",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: can break reading glasses."
