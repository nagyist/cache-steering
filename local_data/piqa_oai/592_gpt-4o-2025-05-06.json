    "steps": [
        "Wall art, especially if it is heavy, needs to be securely mounted to prevent damage to the wall and the art itself.",
        "Drilling screws into the wall without considering the heaviness of the art can cause the art to fall and damage the wall if the attachment is not strong enough.",
        "Studs are structural elements of the wall and provide a much stronger support compared to just the drywall.",
        "If the wall art is heavy, drilling into studs ensures that it hangs securely and prevents the art from ripping itself out of the wall.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Make sure if the wall art is heavy to ensure to drill into studs and the art can rip itself out of the wall."
