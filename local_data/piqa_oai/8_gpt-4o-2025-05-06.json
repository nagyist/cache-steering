    "steps": [
        "Boiling eggs typically involves submerging them in water since water transfers heat efficiently and evenly to the eggs.",
        "Starting with cold water helps gradually increase the temperature, reducing the risk of the eggs cracking due to sudden temperature changes.",
        "The instruction specifies bringing the water to a boil over medium-high heat, which ensures even cooking without overheating.",
        "After the water reaches a boil, covering the pot and removing it from heat allows the eggs to cook gently and evenly in the hot water without further heating.",
        "Setting the eggs aside for 8 to 10 minutes ensures they are cooked through to the desired consistency.",
        "Choice B correctly follows the standard procedure for boiling eggs by specifying the use of cold water, so B is the right answer."
