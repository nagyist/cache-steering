    "steps": [
        "To saute onions, you need a method that allows them to cook evenly and brown without burning.",
        "First, adding oil to the pan is necessary as it serves as the medium for heat transfer and prevents the onions from sticking to the pan.",
        "Next, you must wait for the pan to get hot, typically a few minutes, to ensure that the onions start cooking immediately when they are added.",
        "Once the pan is hot, you add the onions to the pan.",
        "Continuously stirring the onions is crucial to achieve even browning and to prevent burning.",
        "A disposable spoon is not practical for this task as it may not withstand the heat and might melt or break.",
        "Using a spoon or spatula made of materials suitable for cooking ensures durability and effective stirring.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Add oil to your pan and wait for the pan to get hot roughly a few minutes. Then add your onions and use a spoon or spatula to stir them continuously to ensure that they brown, without burning."
