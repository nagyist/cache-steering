    "question": "How to simply organize cables?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use some empty toilet rolls and place them in a shoebox, then roll the cables tightly and place them inside the toilet rolls\nB: Use some fresh toilet rolls and place them in a shoebox, then roll the cables tightly and place them between the toilet rolls",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the best method to simply organize cables, consider the practicality and resource usage of each option.",
        "Option A suggests using empty toilet rolls, which means reusing materials that would typically be discarded, promoting recycling and resource efficiency.",
        "This option also entails rolling the cables tightly and placing them inside the toilet rolls, ensuring that the cables remain untangled and neatly organized within a shoebox.",
        "Option B suggests using fresh toilet rolls, which implies using new materials that could otherwise be used for their intended purpose. This is less resource-efficient and could lead to unnecessary waste.",
        "Additionally, rolling the cables and placing them between the fresh toilet rolls does not offer the same level of containment as placing them inside empty rolls, potentially leading to less organization and more tangling.",
        "Hence, the more practical and eco-friendly choice is Option A."
