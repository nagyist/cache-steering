    "question": "How can I darken wood?\n\nChoices:\nA: Using a soft cloth rub with linseed oil.\nB: Using a soft cloth rub with baby oil.",
    "steps": [
        "To darken wood, one typically uses an oil that penetrates the wood fibers and adds a darker tone. Linseed oil is known for its ability to penetrate deeply into the wood and provide a rich, darker finish.",
        "Linseed oil has been traditionally used for finishing wood, offering both protection and enhancement of the wood's natural color.",
        "Baby oil, on the other hand, is primarily a mineral oil used for moisturizing skin. It does not have the properties to darken wood effectively.",
        "Therefore, the most appropriate choice for darkening wood is linseed oil.",
        "The correct answer is A: Using a soft cloth rub with linseed oil."
