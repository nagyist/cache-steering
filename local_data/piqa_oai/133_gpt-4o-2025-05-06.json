    "question": "How do I melt wax ?\n\nChoices:\nA: Put the wax in a pot and put the pot on the stove and heat the pot at low heat, stir gently the pot while the wax is melting.\nB: Put the wax in a strainer and put the strainer on the stove and heat the strainer at low heat, stir gently the strainer while the wax is melting.",
    "steps": [
        "To melt wax, you need a container that can safely hold the wax and distribute heat evenly.",
        "A pot is designed for holding liquids and solids and can be placed directly on the stove for heating.",
        "A strainer, on the other hand, is designed for draining liquids and is not suitable for holding wax or enduring direct heating on the stove.",
        "Heating the wax at low heat is necessary to avoid burning and to ensure it melts smoothly.",
        "Stirring gently helps the wax melt evenly and prevents it from sticking or burning at the bottom.",
        "Based on the above reasoning, the correct method for melting wax is to put it in a pot and heat it on the stove at low heat while stirring gently."
