    "steps": [
        "When navigating through a large crowd of people, maintaining focus on a specific point in the distance can help you discern the clearest path and move directly towards it.",
        "By looking ahead and focusing on a distant point, you naturally adjust your movements to avoid obstacles and people, making your journey smoother and more efficient.",
        "On the other hand, gently pushing people out of the way while walking is considered rude and could lead to conflicts or slower progression through the crowd.",
        "Thus, focusing on a point in the distance as you walk is a more effective and courteous method to navigate through a large crowd of people.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: focus on a point in the distance as you walk."
