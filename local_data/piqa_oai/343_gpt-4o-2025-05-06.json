    "steps": [
        "One common method to check the doneness of meat is to measure its internal temperature.",
        "A meat thermometer is a specific tool designed to give you an accurate reading of the internal temperature of the meat.",
        "Different types of meat have specific recommended internal temperatures to be considered fully cooked and safe to eat.",
        "Inserting a meat thermometer probe into the center of the meat is a reliable way to get an accurate reading of the internal temperature, ensuring that the meat is cooked properly and safely.",
        "While inserting a fork into the meat might give some indication of doneness based on texture or appearance, it cannot provide an exact internal temperature measurement.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: insert a meat thermometer probe into the center of the meat."
