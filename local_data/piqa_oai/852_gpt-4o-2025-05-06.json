    "question": "How do you cook sugar beets to make beet sugar?\n\nChoices:\nA: Place diced beets into a large pot and fill it with water until the beets are completely covered. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the head to medium and allow to simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beets are tender. Strain the water from the beets into a clean pot.\nB: Place diced beets into a large pot and fill it with water until the beets are completely covered. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the head to medium and allow to simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beets are hard. Strain the water from the beets into a clean pot.",
    "steps": [
        "To make beet sugar, the sugar beets need to be cooked until they are tender. This process involves boiling and then simmering the beets for a period of time.",
        "Once the beets are tender, this indicates that the cell walls have broken down sufficiently to release the sugars.",
        "Straining the water from the tender beets allows the liquid to contain the dissolved sugars, which can then be further processed into beet sugar.",
        "Option A describes cooking the beets until they are tender, which is the appropriate consistency for extracting the sugars.",
        "Option B describes cooking the beets until they are hard, which would not allow the sugars to be released effectively.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Place diced beets into a large pot and fill it with water until the beets are completely covered. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the head to medium and allow to simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beets are tender. Strain the water from the beets into a clean pot."
