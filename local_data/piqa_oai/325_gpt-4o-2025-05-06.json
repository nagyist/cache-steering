Sew around all 3 sides and leave one end open. Hem that end. Insert pillow.\nB: Get some material you like and measure your pillow. Make sure you have enough material to cover this twice. Sew around all 3 sides and leave one end open. Hem that end. Insert pillow.",
    "steps": [
        "When making pillowcases, you need to ensure that the material can fully cover the pillow.",
        "Choice A suggests covering only the top of the pillow, which isn't sufficient as the pillowcase needs to cover both the top and bottom of the pillow.",
        "Choice B correctly instructs to measure enough material to cover the pillow twice, ensuring that both sides of the pillow are covered.",
        "Sewing around three sides while leaving one end open allows for inserting and removing the pillow.",
        "Hemming the open end provides a finished look and prevents fraying.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B."
