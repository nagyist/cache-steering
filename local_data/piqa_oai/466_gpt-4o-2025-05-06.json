    "question": "To affix a USB port to power wires, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Solder the wires to the appropriate contacts on the inner side of the USB port\nB: Staple the wires to the appropriate contacts on the inner side of the USB port",
    "steps": [
        "USB ports require a reliable and stable connection to ensure proper functionality.",
        "Soldering creates a strong electrical connection by melting solder around the wires and contacts, effectively bonding them together.",
        "Soldering provides durability and prevents accidental disconnection as compared to other methods.",
        "Stapling is not a suitable method for electrical connections due to its weak mechanical bond and risk of causing shorts or interruptions.",
        "Therefore, the appropriate method for affixing a USB port to power wires is to solder the wires to the appropriate contacts on the inner side of the USB port."
