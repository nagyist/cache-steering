    "steps": [
        "Start by understanding the context of cooking pasta. Pasta is typically cooked in boiling water until it reaches the desired texture and then drained. After draining, how the pasta is treated can affect its quality and taste.",
        "Option A suggests that washing the pasta in vinegar after draining is a bad idea. While it might not be a common practice, vinegar is not typically used in pasta preparation, so this option is less relevant to standard cooking procedures.",
        "Option B suggests not rinsing the pasta after draining. This is important because rinsing can wash away the starch that helps the sauce adhere to the pasta, affecting the overall texture and flavor negatively.",
        "Since Option B addresses a more common practice and provides a valid reason for maintaining pasta quality, it is the correct answer."
