    "steps": [
        "First, analyze the objective of making the sauce lighter in color and smoother in taste.",
        "Adding cream to any sauce typically lightens the color due to the creamy, white hue of the cream.",

        "Next, consider the effect of adding tomato paste. Tomato paste has a deep red color and a strong, concentrated taste. Adding this ingredient would likely darken the sauce's color and intensify its flavor.",
        "In conclusion, adding cream to the sauce aligns better with the goal of making the sauce lighter in color and smoother in taste.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Add some cream to the sauce."
