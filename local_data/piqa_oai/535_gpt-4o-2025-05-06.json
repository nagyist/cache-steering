    "question": "To make a cup of hot tea,\n\nChoices:\nA: place a tea bag into a cup, boil water and pour over the tea bag, filling the cup six-quarters of the way full, and steep the tea for four minutes.\nB: place a tea bag into a cup, boil water and pour over the tea bag, filling the cup three-quarters of the way full, and steep the tea for four minutes.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to determine the ideal way to make a cup of hot tea.",
        "We start by placing a tea bag into a cup. Both choices include this step, so it is correct in both A and B.",
        "Next, we need to boil water. Again, both choices include this step, so it is correct in both A and B.",
        "After boiling, we pour the hot water over the tea bag in the cup. Both choices include this step, making it correct in both A and B.",
        "Now, we need to consider how much water should be poured into the cup. Generally, the standard recommendation for making tea is to fill the cup three-quarters of the way full, which is given in choice B.",
        "Choice A suggests filling the cup six-quarters of the way full. This is not a standard practice and does not make practical sense, as six-quarters would overflow the cup.",
        "Finally, steeping the tea for four minutes is included in both choices, which is correct for both.",
        "Combining all these steps, choice B accurately reflects the correct way to make a cup of hot tea."
