    "steps": [
        "When a car engine is overheating, one effective way to help cool it down is to maximize heat removal from the engine.",
        "Car heaters work by transferring heat from the engine coolant to the interior of the car.",
        "Turning on the heater allows the heat from the engine coolant to be transferred into the cabin of the car, thereby pulling heat away from the engine.",
        "In contrast, turning off the heater would stop this heat transfer, potentially causing the engine to retain more heat.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice to help stop the car from overheating is to turn on the heater."
