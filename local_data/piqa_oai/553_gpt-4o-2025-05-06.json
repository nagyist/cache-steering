    "steps": [
        "To carve a pattern into a wooden fence, you need to start by drawing your pattern onto the wood.",
        "You will need a tool to cut along the lines of your pattern, and both a jigsaw and router are suitable options.",
        "To insert these tools into the wood and start cutting the pattern, you need to create an initial hole.",
        "A drill bit is specifically designed to create holes in wood, making it suitable for this task.",
        "A box cutter is not the appropriate tool for creating holes in thick wood, as it is primarily used for cutting thinner materials like cardboard or plastic.",
        "Therefore, using a drill bit is the correct choice to make the initial hole in the wooden sheet so that you can then use the jigsaw or router to cut the pattern.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A."
