    "question": "Natural mosquito repellent?\n\nChoices:\nA: Lavender essential oil is undetectable by mosquitoes. Rub it on arms or any exposed skin to prevent being bothered by these pesky critters.\nB: Lavender essential oil is detested by mosquitoes. Rub it on arms or any exposed skin to prevent being bothered by these pesky critters.",
    "steps": [
        "We start by analyzing the key element that distinguishes the two given choices: the effect of lavender essential oil on mosquitoes.",
        "Option A mentions that lavender essential oil is \"undetectable by mosquitoes.\" This implies that mosquitoes would not sense the presence of the oil, which does not logically lead to preventing mosquito bites.",
        "Option B states that lavender essential oil is \"detested by mosquitoes,\" meaning that mosquitoes actively avoid the scent. Consequently, rubbing it on exposed skin would help in keeping mosquitoes away.",
        "Since the goal of a mosquito repellent is to deter mosquitoes, we conclude that option B aligns better with this goal because it mentions that the mosquitoes avoid the scent of lavender essential oil.",
        "Finally, we verify that the instruction to rub it on arms or any exposed skin is consistent in both options, so our decision is based correctly on the effectiveness of the lavender oil in repelling mosquitoes.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Lavender essential oil is detested by mosquitoes. Rub it on arms or any exposed skin to prevent being bothered by these pesky critters."
