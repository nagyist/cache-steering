    "steps": [
        "To dig a hole, you need to create a depression in the ground.",
        "Creating a depression requires removing soil from one specific area.",
        "Scooping up dirt repeatedly in one spot allows you to progressively remove soil and make the hole deeper.",
        "By scooping up dirt in multiple spots, you wouldn't create a single, deep hole but rather multiple shallow depressions.",
        "Therefore, the correct method for digging a hole outside is to scoop up the dirt repeatedly in one spot."
