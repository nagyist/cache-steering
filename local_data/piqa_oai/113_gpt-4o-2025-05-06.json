    "steps": [
        "To determine how long an item should be in a project, you need to know the physical measurement of dimensions.",
        "A tape measure is specifically designed for measuring lengths and dimensions accurately.",
        "On the other hand, masking tape is typically used for labeling, marking, or temporarily securing items, not for measurement purposes.",
        "Therefore, the appropriate tool for determining how long an item should be in a project is a tape measure.",
