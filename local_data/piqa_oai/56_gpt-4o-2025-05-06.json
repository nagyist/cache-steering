    "steps": [
        "Consider the material of metal cutlery. Metal is typically dense and hard, making it difficult to cut through with simple tools.",
        "A hand saw is designed to cut through various materials, including metal. It has serrated edges that can make precise cuts with significant force applied.",
        "In contrast, a hand drill is designed to make holes, not cut through long sections of metal. While it can drill through metal, it is not practical for cutting handles.",
        "Thus, the correct tool for cutting handles off metal cutlery would be a hand saw because it is specifically designed to make such cuts.",
        "Based on the functionality and design of the tools provided, the correct answer is:\nA: Use a hand saw to cut the handles."
