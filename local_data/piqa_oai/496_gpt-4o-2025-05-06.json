        "To determine how to best secure the backing board of a barn door to its frame, it is important to consider the materials involved and the type of adhesive that would be most effective.",
        "Rubber cement is typically used for bonding materials like paper and may not provide a strong or durable bond for wooden structures.",
        "Wood glue, on the other hand, is specifically designed to bond wooden materials together. It will create a stronger and more reliable connection for the backing board to the frame.",
        "The instruction includes placing wood slats next to each other, indicating that the wood glue's properties are crucial for ensuring the slats remain securely adhered to the frame.",
        "Considering the purpose and the materials, wood glue is the appropriate choice for securing the wood slats to the frame.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Spread wood glue on the back of the frame, and place wood slats next to each other until the frame is covered."
