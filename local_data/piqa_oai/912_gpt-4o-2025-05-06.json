        "When looking for a way to prevent fingerprints on a sink faucet, one logical approach is to use a material that creates a smooth, non-stick surface.",
        "Wax paper is coated with a thin layer of wax, which can act as a barrier and reduce the likelihood of fingerprints sticking to the faucet.",
        "Cardboard paper, being rough and absorbent, would not create the same smooth surface and is unlikely to prevent fingerprints effectively.",
        "Therefore, out of the given choices, the correct answer is: A: Wipe sink faucet with wax paper."
