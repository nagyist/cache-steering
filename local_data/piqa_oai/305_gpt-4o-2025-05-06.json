    "question": "To create a back piece of a chair,\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut two pieces of plywood to size and sand the edges down until they are round. Stain if desired.\nB: Cut three pieces of plywood to size and sand the edges down until they are round. Stain if desired.",
    "steps": [
        "We start with understanding what is generally needed to create the back piece of a chair.",
        "Typically, a chair back consists of a single piece or divided into two symmetrical pieces, which makes cutting two pieces more common.",
        "Next, we consider the task requirements which mention cutting plywood.",
        "Both choices involve cutting plywood to size and sanding the edges.",
        "However, choice B involves cutting three pieces, which is less typical for a chair back design.",
        "Therefore, the more common and practical approach involves cutting two pieces of plywood, which matches choice A.",
        "Thus, choice A is the correct answer."

    "solution": "A"
