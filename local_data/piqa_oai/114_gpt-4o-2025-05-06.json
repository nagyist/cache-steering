    "steps": [
        "To determine the best way to hang lights without showing the hanging mechanism, we need to consider the visibility of the hooks both during the day and at night.",
        "The hooks should be small so they are less noticeable.",
        "Black hooks are less reflective and blend in better with the night environment compared to white hooks.",
        "Since small, black hooks blend into the darkness, they are less likely to be visible, making them the best choice for hanging lights discreetly.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: When placing up the lights drape them over small, black hooks which will be undetectable to the eye at night."
