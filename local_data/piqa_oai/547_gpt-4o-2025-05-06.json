    "steps": [
        "Identify the main task from the question: \"Hang a bird cage from the ceiling.\" The focus is on suspending the bird cage from a point above.",
        "Analyze Choice A: \"Install a hook in the floor and hang a chain from it. Place another hook on the chain and hang the bird cage from that hook.\" Installing a hook in the floor will not achieve the goal of hanging a bird cage from the ceiling.",
        "Analyze Choice B: \"Install a hook in the ceiling and hang a chain from it. Place another hook on the chain and hang the bird cage from that hook.\" This choice involves placing a hook in the ceiling, which correctly aligns with the task of hanging the bird cage from above.",
        "Evaluate the logical explanation: The ceiling is the appropriate location for installing a hook to hang a bird cage. By installing the hook in the ceiling, hanging a chain, and then placing another hook on the chain for the bird cage, the goal described in the question is accomplished effectively.",
        "Conclude that Choice B correctly addresses the task of hanging the bird cage from the ceiling, unlike Choice A which suggests using the floor."
