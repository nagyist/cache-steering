    "steps": [
        "To make a human-sized body shell, you need a material that can hold its shape once it has been removed from the body.",
        "Cling wrap is generally too flexible and would not maintain the form of the body well enough to be considered a shell.",
        "Duct tape, on the other hand, is much more rigid and capable of holding the shape once it has been removed from the body.",
        "The process should involve first wrapping the person in cling wrap to protect their skin and create a smooth base layer.",
        "Then, wrap the cling-wrapped person with duct tape from head to toe. The duct tape will form the outer shell.",
        "Carefully cut the duct tape layer and the cling wrap layer together to remove the shell without cutting the person inside.",
        "The duct tape (which is now the shell) will retain the shape of the body and can be used as a mold or a body shell.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Wrap someone in cling wrap then duct tape from head to toe and then cut it of them - the duct tape is now the shell."
