    "steps": [
        "Windshield-washer fluid needs to be a solution that can effectively clean the windshield, usually containing a solvent, water, and a detergent. Vanilla pudding is not a solvent and would likely leave residue on the windshield.",
        "Vodka, on the other hand, can act as a solvent and help remove dirt and debris from the windshield. It does not leave residue behind because it evaporates quickly.",
        "Liquid dishwashing detergent is included to help break down grease and grime.",
        "Therefore, mixing 3 cups vodka with 4 cups water and 2 teaspoons of liquid dishwashing detergent is a feasible recipe for homemade windshield-washer fluid.",
