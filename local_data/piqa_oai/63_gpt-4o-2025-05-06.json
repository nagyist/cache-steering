Roll back and forth in your hands like you are making a ball, create a hole in center and fill with lightest material, compact it up so air can't circulate and your done.\nB: Gather fibrous grasses, bark and other lightweight easily flammable material . Roll back and forth in your hands like you are making a ball, create a hole in center and fill with lightest material, fluff it up so air can circulate and your done.",
    "steps": [
        "To make a tinder bundle, you need materials that can catch fire easily.",
        "You start by gathering fibrous grasses, bark, and other lightweight, easily flammable materials.",
        "Next, you roll the materials back and forth in your hands to form a ball.",
        "Then, you create a hole in the center of the ball and fill it with the lightest material.",
        "It is important for the tinder bundle to be fluffed up to allow air circulation. This is necessary for combustion as air (oxygen) helps in maintaining the flame.",
        "Compactly packing the bundle would hinder air circulation, making it difficult for the fire to ignite and sustain.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Gather fibrous grasses, bark and other lightweight easily flammable material . Roll back and forth in your hands like you are making a ball, create a hole in center and fill with lightest material, fluff it up so air can circulate and your done."
