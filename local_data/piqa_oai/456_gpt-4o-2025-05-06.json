    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for making a bubble wand using medium wire, we need to evaluate the tools mentioned and their suitability for bending wire.",
        "Option A suggests using a pair of fingers to bend the wire into a loop or desired shape. Fingers may not provide enough force or precision to bend medium wire effectively, especially to create a neat and functional loop.",
        "Option B suggests using a pair of pliers to bend the wire into a loop or desired shape. Pliers are specifically designed for manipulating wire and provide the necessary grip and force to bend it properly.",
        "Considering the practicality and effectiveness of the tools mentioned, Option B is the correct answer as it recommends using pliers, which are better suited for bending medium wire."
