    "steps": [
        "First, consider the physical properties of logs. Logs are typically chunks of tree trunks or branches, which are usually heavy and require significant strength to lift or toss.",
        "Next, evaluate the abilities of a mouse. A mouse is a very small and weak creature, incapable of lifting or tossing anything as large and heavy as a log.",
        "Then, think about a human's capabilities. Humans vary in strength, and many individuals can lift and toss heavy objects. Additionally, log tossing is an actual competitive event in some cultures, such as the caber toss in Scottish Highland games.",
        "Considering the definitions and physical capabilities, a log cannot reasonably be tossed by a mouse, but it can be tossed by a human in a sporting competition.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: can be tossed by a human for a sporting competition."
