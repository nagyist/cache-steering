    "question": "How can I stop a mosquito bite from itching?\n\nChoices:\nA: Heat up a coin under a candle or lighter for a moment, then place the coin under your tongue.  This will kill the proteins that cause the itch.\nB: Heat up a coin under a candle or lighter for a moment, then place the coin on the bite.  This will kill the proteins that cause the itch.",
    "steps": [
        "When a mosquito bites, it injects proteins into the skin that can cause itching and an inflammatory response.",
        "Applying heat to the bite can break down these proteins, thereby reducing the itching sensation.",
        "Placing a heated coin directly on the bite applies heat to the affected area, which can help to denature the proteins that cause itching.",
        "Placing the coin under the tongue would not have any effect on the proteins injected into the skin by the mosquito.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Heat up a coin under a candle or lighter for a moment, then place the coin on the bite. This will kill the proteins that cause the itch."
