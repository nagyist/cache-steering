    "steps": [
        "To determine whether a wrench can break the glass or a tree, we need to understand the typical uses and capabilities of a wrench.",
        "A wrench is a tool designed for gripping and turning objects, especially nuts and bolts.",
        "While a wrench can exert considerable force, it is typically designed for mechanical tasks rather than breaking objects like trees.",
        "Glass is a brittle material, meaning it can be broken with a certain amount of force and impact.",
        "Given the tool's design and the nature of the materials, a wrench could feasibly break glass by applying force directly to it. This is consistent with the tool's potential and the brittle nature of glass.",
        "Conversely, a tree is much more durable and rigid compared to glass. Breaking a tree requires significant force and usually specialized equipment such as an axe or chainsaw.",
        "Thus, of the two options given, a wrench is more likely to break glass than to break a tree.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: can break the glass."
