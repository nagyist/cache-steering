    "question": "To make boxes easier to carry\n\nChoices:\nA: cut out inverted triangles one third of the way down\nB: cut out inverted triangles one third of the way up",
    "steps": [
        "If the goal is to make boxes easier to carry, considering the placement of the cutouts is important to ensure comfortable handling and lifting.",
        "When inclined to carry an object, human hands naturally grip towards the lower part of the object, which offers better leverage and control.",
        "Cutting out inverted triangles one third of the way down will create handles positioned where it's most naturally comfortable and efficient for carrying.",
        "On the other hand, cutting out inverted triangles one third of the way up the box would position the handles too high, likely causing awkward lifting angles and making the box harder to carry.",
        "Therefore, the placement of the cutouts should be lower on the box for ergonomic handling, making the correct choice \"cut out inverted triangles one third of the way down\"."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
