    "question": "How can I get blackheads off my face?\n\nChoices:\nA: Cover them with Elmers glue, allow the glue to dry and peel them off with the glue.\nB: Cover them with cow offal, allow the offal to dry and peel them off with the offal.",
    "steps": [
        "Blackheads are a type of acne caused by clogged pores, and are usually removed by methods that exfoliate the skin or physically extract the blackheads.",
        "Elmers glue, which is non-toxic and used in many DIY beauty hacks, can adhere to the surface of the skin and possibly help in peeling off blackheads when dried due to its sticky nature.",
        "Cow offal, which consists of internal organs, is not known to have properties that would help in removing blackheads. In fact, applying cow offal to the face might introduce bacteria and cause more skin issues.",
        "Based on these observations, option A seems reasonable as the glue can stick to blackheads and remove them when peeled off, while option B with cow offal is not a safe or effective method.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Cover them with Elmers glue, allow the glue to dry and peel them off with the glue."
