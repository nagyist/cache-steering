    "question": "penny\n\nChoices:\nA: could destroy a grater \nB: can purchase a grater with enough of them",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify what a \"penny\" is. A penny is a unit of currency, specifically in the United States, where it is worth one cent.",
        "Next, analyze option A: \"could destroy a grater\". Consider whether a penny has the physical properties necessary to destroy a kitchen grater. A penny is small and made of a soft metal, so it is unlikely to destroy a grater.",
        "Now, examine option B: \"can purchase a grater with enough of them\". Since a penny is money, accumulating enough of them can be used to purchase items, including a grater.",
        "Comparing both options, option B is more plausible and appropriate based on the practical uses of a penny and the context given.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: can purchase a grater with enough of them."

    "solution": "B"
