    "steps": [
        "To make pancakes, you typically need to pour the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.",
        "Using a container with a spout can help control the flow of the batter and reduce spills.",
        "An empty pickle jar usually has a wider mouth and does not have a spout, making it harder to pour batter without making a mess.",
        "An empty ketchup bottle has a narrow opening and a spout designed for controlled pouring.",
        "The narrow spout of the ketchup bottle allows for more precise pouring of the pancake batter, reducing drips and spills.",
        "Hence, putting pancake mix into an empty ketchup bottle will help make more efficient pancakes in a cleaner kitchen.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Put pancake mix into an empty ketchup bottle to help make more efficient pancakes in a cleaner kitchen."
