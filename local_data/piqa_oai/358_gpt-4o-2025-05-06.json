    "question": "To prepare yeast for bread making.\n\nChoices:\nA: Heat up your water to 105 to 115 F. Then add in about 1 tsp. of sugar to the warm water. Next add in your yeast. You can agitate it a bit with a fork. Now let it sit for about 10 minutes until it gets nice and foamy/frothy. If after 10 minutes it isn't foamy, you need to start again. The yeast might be bad/old, or the water was too hot or too cold.\nB: Heat up your water to 105 to 115 F. Then add in about 1 tsp. of sugar to the warm water. Next add in your yeast.

        "The steps in the process of preparing yeast for bread making are described.",
        "The primary action involves some specific techniques for adding and agitating yeast into a warm sugar solution.",
        "The first step in both choices is the same: heating water to 105-115 F. Then, each choice involves adding sugar to the warm water.",
        "Both choices include adding yeast to the sugared warm water and suggest a waiting period of about 10 minutes until the mixture becomes foamy/frothy.",
        "The differences between the choices lie in the method of agitation. Choice A suggests using a fork, while Choice B suggests using your hand.",
        "Best practices for hygiene and more precise agitation involve using a utensil like a fork rather than your hand, which can introduce contaminants and inconsistencies.",
