    "question": "To put a measured amount of liquid soap into a spray bottle.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a spoon to put a little liquid soap into a spray bottle.\nB: Use a mason jar to pour liquid soap into a spray bottle.",
    "steps": [
        "When you need to ensure that a specific measured amount of liquid soap is added to a spray bottle, using a precise tool is important.",
        "A spoon can help control the amount of liquid soap being transferred, allowing for accurate measurement.",
        "Using a mason jar to pour the liquid soap might lead to over-pouring because mason jars don't have the precision needed for measuring smaller, specific amounts.",
        "Therefore, using a spoon provides better control and precision for this task.",
        "With this reasoning, we conclude that the correct choice is A: Use a spoon to put a little liquid soap into a spray bottle."
