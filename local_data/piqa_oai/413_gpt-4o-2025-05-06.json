    "question": "To cut perfect cookies\n\nChoices:\nA: With scissors, cut a large rectangle of baking parchment and lay it out on a cutting board. Still in the bowl, take your cookie dough and roll it into a ball with your clean hands. Place the ball in the center of the baking parchment and start rolling it back and forth with your hands, so that it starts to elongate into a fat cylinder. Keep rolling back and forth, keeping the shape evenly cylindrical as it lengthens, until it's a long, fat sausage the width of the cookies you want to make. Tuck the ends of the parchment over the ends of the dough, and starting at one side tightly wrap the sausage of dough up in the parchment. Place it in the refrigerator overnight to cool. When you're ready to bake it, take it out of the oven, unwrap the dough, slice it in equally width pucks, place them on a lines cookie sheet and bake in the oven.\nB: With scissors, cut a large rectangle of baking parchment and lay it out on a cutting board.

    "steps": [
        "Choice A describes a process that involves unwrapping the dough before slicing it into equally width pucks.",
        "Choice B mentions slicing the dough while it is still wrapped in the parchment paper, which is not typically how cookies are prepared, as the paper can interfere with slicing and the shape of the cookies.",
        "Therefore, the more accurate method for cutting perfect cookies is to unwrap the dough before slicing, as described in Choice A.",
        "Thus, Choice A is the correct answer."
