    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the function and characteristics of an earring back.",
        "An earring back is a small piece, typically metal or plastic, used to keep an earring in place.",
        "Considering the size and sharpness of an earring back, it is more likely to be suitable for carving small and delicate surfaces rather than large hard surfaces.",
        "An iced cake is a soft and manageable surface where precise and small carvings can be made.",
        "In contrast, an iced sidewalk is a large and hard surface, making it difficult for a small accessory like an earring back to carve into.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: can carve words into iced cake."
