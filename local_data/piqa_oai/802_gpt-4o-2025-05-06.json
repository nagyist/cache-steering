        "To determine how to fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients when making macarons, we need to consider the typical method used.",
        "Folding ingredients in macaron-making generally involves using a spatula to gently combine the ingredients. This is a delicate process to ensure the batter maintains the right consistency and doesn't deflate.",
        "The process typically involves adding dry ingredients in parts to avoid overwhelming the wet ingredients and to ensure even incorporation.",
        "A common method is to add 1/3 of the dry ingredients at a time, fold gently around 15-20 times each addition until the mixture is fully combined.",
        "Since folding ensures gentle incorporation and avoids overworking the batter, a spatula rather than a sponge (which could be too abrasive and not appropriate for mixing) is used.",
        "Thus, combining all steps and methods, the correct instruction for folding dry ingredients into wet ingredients for macarons is: \"Add a third of the dry ingredients and fold about 15-20 times with a spatula. Repeat. When it's completely combined, you should have folded about 60 times.\""
