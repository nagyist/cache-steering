    "steps": [
        "Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked, which is how to open the sunroof on a car.",
        "Evaluate option A: \"press the button to open the windows on the door handle.\"\nReason: This option does not seem directly relevant to opening a sunroof, as it refers to a window control on the door handle.",
        "Evaluate option B: \"press the button to open it on the roof.\"\nReason: Cars typically have controls for the sunroof located on or near the roof of the car, often overhead console.",
        "Determine that option B is more logically consistent with the location of sunroof controls in most cars.",
        "Conclude that the correct answer is B: \"press the button to open it on the roof,\" as it aligns with common sunroof control locations."
