    "steps": [
        "Frizzy hair is often caused by dryness, humidity, or damage, and controlling it usually involves using products that can smooth the hair and provide some level of hold.",
        "Rubbing a towel over hair can actually increase frizz. The friction from the towel can cause the hair cuticles to lift, making the hair appear even frizzier.",
        "Hairspray, on the other hand, is designed to help hold the hairstyle in place and can smooth down the hair, reducing the appearance of frizz. It typically contains ingredients that can help smooth the hair and provide a protective barrier against humidity.",
