    "steps": [
        "First, consider the shape and structure of a razor head. It typically has exposed blades on the outside part, which are sharp and can cause injuries if not handled carefully.",
        "Next, evaluate the purpose of using a binder clip. A binder clip is designed to clamp down firmly on objects and can provide a protective barrier.",
        "If a heavy binder clip is clipped over the outside of the razor, it will cover the blades, preventing accidental cuts or damage to the razor head.",
        "Conversely, if a binder clip is clipped over the inside of the razor, it will not provide the same protective barrier for the blades, since the blades remain exposed.",
        "Therefore, to protect and make the razor head safe when not in use, clipping a heavy binder clip over the outside of the razor is the correct solution."
