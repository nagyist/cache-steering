    "question": "To make finish soak into wood, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Buff it with candle wax\nB: Buff it with beeswax",
    "steps": [
        "To solve the question, first understand the properties and applications of candle wax and beeswax.",
        "Candle wax, often made from paraffin, is less permeable and does not easily soak into wood. It creates a superficial layer instead of penetrating deeply.",
        "Beeswax, on the other hand, is more permeable and has natural properties that allow it to soak into wood fibers more effectively. This helps in achieving a better finish by filling in pores and providing deep conditioning.",
        "Therefore, using beeswax is more suited for making the finish soak into the wood.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Buff it with beeswax."
