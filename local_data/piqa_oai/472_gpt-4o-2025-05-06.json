    "question": "floss\n\nChoices:\nA: suspend cardboard easily\nB: suspend shovel easily",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the nature of floss. Floss is a thin, strong thread primarily used for dental hygiene.",
        "Next, evaluate the term \"suspend,\" which means to hold something up or hang.",
        "Now, compare the objects involved in the choices provided: cardboard and a shovel. Cardboard is lightweight and could easily be suspended by floss without breaking it.",
        "A shovel is typically heavy and bulky, which would be difficult for floss to suspend without breaking or failing.",
        "Based on the comparison, floss has the capacity to suspend something light like cardboard rather than a heavy object like a shovel.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: suspend cardboard easily."
