    "steps": [
        "Freezing mozzarella sticks properly before deep frying ensures that they hold their shape and cook evenly.",
        "Step 1: Lay the mozzarella sticks on a baking sheet. This prevents them from sticking together and allows for even freezing.",
        "Step 2: Cover the baking sheet with foil to protect the sticks from freezer burn and other odors in the freezer.",
        "Step 3: Place the baking sheet in the freezer. It is important to freeze them fully.",
        "The final consideration is the freezing time. Mozzarella sticks need to be completely solid to fry properly.",
        "Option A mentions that freezing can take a few seconds to a minute, which is incorrect because complete freezing of food items generally takes longer.",
        "Option B correctly states that freezing can take a few hours to a day, which aligns with typical freezing times for food items in a standard freezer.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B."
