        "First, understand the definition of an interception in football.",
        "An interception in football occurs when a defensive player catches a pass that was intended for an offensive player.",
        "This action stops the offensive team from continuing their offensive play and gives possession of the ball to the intercepting player's team.",
        "In the given choices, you must determine which situation matches this definition.",
        "Choice A states, \"catch the football when it is thrown by the opposing team's quarterback.\" This accurately reflects the nature of an interception, as it involves intercepting a pass intended for the opposing team.",
        "Choice B states, \"catch the football when it is thrown by your own quarterback.\" This would simply be a reception, not an interception.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer aligns with the definition of an interception.",
        "The chosen answer is A: catch the football when it is thrown by the opposing team's quarterback."
