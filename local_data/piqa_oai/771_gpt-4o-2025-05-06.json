    "question": "To make a grilled cheese extra gooey,\n\nChoices:\nA: cook it for twice as long.\nB: put two slices instead of one.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the goal: making the grilled cheese extra gooey.",
        "Gooeyness is typically a characteristic achieved by the amount of cheese rather than the cooking duration.",
        "Cooking it for twice as long (Option A) might make the cheese more melted, but it could also overcook the bread, making it less desirable.",
        "Adding more cheese (Option B) directly increases the amount of melted, gooey cheese in the sandwich.",
        "Therefore, adding two slices of cheese instead of one is the more effective method to achieve extra gooeyness.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: put two slices instead of one."

    "solution": "B"
