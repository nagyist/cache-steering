    "question": "How do you make a wind chime out of shells?\n\nChoices:\nA: Find shells that have large holes in them. Use a piece of small driftwood and tie your shells onto the driftwood with fishing string.\nB: Find shells that have small holes in them. Use a piece of small driftwood and tie your shells onto the driftwood with fishing string.",
    "steps": [
        "To create a wind chime out of shells, one first needs to determine the type of shells required.",
        "The question provides two options, A and B, where the primary difference lies in the size of the holes in the shells - large holes (A) or small holes (B).",
        "In order to have the shells securely attached to the driftwood, small holes in the shells would be more practical. Large holes might cause the shells to fall off the string easily, making the wind chime unstable.",
        "Thus, B, which suggests using shells with small holes, would ensure the shells stay fastened to the driftwood better when tied with fishing string.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Find shells that have small holes in them. Use a piece of small driftwood and tie your shells onto the driftwood with fishing string."
