    "question": "How do you see better while driving at night?\n\nChoices:\nA: Switch to your high beams to get a large light.\nB: Attach a flashlight to the outside of your car for driving.",
    "steps": [
        "Visibility is often reduced at night due to lower light levels.",
        "High beams are designed to provide a larger and farther-reaching light field compared to regular or low beams.",
        "Using high beams allows drivers to see further down the road, improving visibility.",
        "Using a flashlight attached to the outside of the car would not provide sufficient illumination and is not practical or safe.",
        "Therefore, switching to high beams is the correct choice for better visibility while driving at night."
