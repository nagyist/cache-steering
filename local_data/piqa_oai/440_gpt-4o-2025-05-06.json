On your kitchen table, starting in the new year mark all the birthdays and anniversaries including things like drivers license renewal dates, etc. on the table top. Use a pen so it's a permanent reminder. No more forgetting important dates.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the purpose of the task, which is to remember important dates like birthdays and anniversaries.",
        "Think about the items mentioned in the choices. One is marking dates on a kitchen calendar, the other is marking dates on a kitchen table. Calendars are specifically designed to keep track of dates.",
        "Evaluate practicality. Calendars are typically used for scheduling and planning, and marking them with a pen for permanent reminders is a common and practical method. Marking a table would be unusual and less practical for remembering dates.",
        "Determine effectiveness. Writing on a calendar makes it easy to see upcoming dates in a structured way, helping to prevent forgetting them. On the table, it would be harder to organize dates and view them efficiently.",
        "Therefore, marking important dates on a kitchen calendar is the reasonable and effective solution."
