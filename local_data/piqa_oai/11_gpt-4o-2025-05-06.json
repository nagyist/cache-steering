Then just let the milk thaw when you get back.\nB: Freeze the milk, but make sure the jug is not more than 3/4 full at most. Then just let the milk thaw when you get back.",
    "steps": [
        "Freezing milk is a practical way to preserve it when you are going to be away for an extended period of time.",
        "When milk freezes, it expands, so it\u2019s important not to fill the jug completely.",
        "A jug that is more than 3/4 full could potentially burst as the milk expands in the freezer.",
        "A jug that is not more than 3/4 full allows space for expansion without risking bursting or spilling.",
        "The correct choice is B: Freeze the milk, but make sure the jug is not more than 3/4 full at most. Then just let the milk thaw when you get back."
