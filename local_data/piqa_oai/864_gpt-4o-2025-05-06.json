    "question": "How to insert plastic triangles into brass rod.\n\nChoices:\nA: Hold plastic rod with one hand and stick the hole from the plastic triangle into the rod. Keep doing this until all triangles are on the rod.\nB: Hold brass rod with one hand and stick the hole from the plastic triangle into the rod. Keep doing this until all triangles are on the rod.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the key components involved in the task: plastic triangles and a brass rod.",
        "Next, understand the fundamental mechanics of the task: inserting the plastic triangles into the brass rod.",
        "Evaluate the feasibility of each given choice: \n  - Choice A involves holding a plastic rod, but the task specifies a brass rod.\n  - Choice B directly mentions the brass rod.",
        "Consider the practicality of each action:\n  - Holding the plastic rod would not help because the task is about inserting items into the brass rod.\n  - Holding the brass rod will allow the plastic triangles to be inserted into it as required.",
        "Conclude that Choice B accurately describes the correct process, involving the correct materials and the correct action.",
        "Choice B: Hold brass rod with one hand and stick the hole from the plastic triangle into the rod. Keep doing this until all triangles are on the rod."
