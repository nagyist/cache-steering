    "question": "To make a toy light saber made from 1 inch poycarbonate tubing glow from the inside out.\n\nChoices:\nA: Insert a mini flash light with 1 inch diameter at the base of the polycarbonate tubing. Tape it to secure it to the tubing.\nB: Insert a mini flash light with 2 inch diameter at the base of the polycarbonate tubing. Tape it to secure it to the tubing.",
    "steps": [
        "Polycarbonate tubing with a diameter of 1 inch requires a light source that can fit snugly within its diameter.",
        "Using a mini flashlight with a 1 inch diameter ensures a tight, secure fit within the tubing, allowing the light to fully illuminate the polycarbonate from the base all the way to the top.",
        "A mini flashlight with a diameter larger than the tubing (like 2 inches) will not fit inside the tubing.",
        "This mismatch would prevent the flashlight from being inserted properly, and consequently, it would not be able to illuminate the tubing effectively from the inside.",
        "Thus, inserting a mini flashlight of 1 inch diameter at the base of the polycarbonate tubing and securing it with tape is the correct approach."
