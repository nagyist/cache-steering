    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for removing permanent marker stains from your body, it is important to consider the nature of both permanent marker inks and the substances being used to remove them.",
        "Permanent markers are difficult to remove because they are designed to be long-lasting and water-resistant. This means that regular soap and water alone may not be effective.",
        "Highlighters contain solvents that can break down the ink of permanent markers. Therefore, using a highlighter to mark over the permanent marker stain can help to dislodge the stain.",
        "Once the stain has been dislodged by the highlighter, it can then be cleaned off with soap and water effectively.",
        "Using a darker permanent marker would not have the same effect because it does not contain the solvents needed to break down the stain. Instead, it would make the stain worse and more difficult to remove.",
        "Hence, the correct method to remove permanent marker stains off your body is to use a highlighter to dislodge the stain and then clean it off with soap and water, making Choice A the correct answer."
