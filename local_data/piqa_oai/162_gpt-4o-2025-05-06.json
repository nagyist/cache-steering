    "steps": [
        "To determine the best option for adding extra storage for kitchen tools, we need to evaluate the size and storage capability of the containers listed in the choices.",
        "The first choice is to store tools in an empty baby wipe container. Baby wipe containers are generally larger and more robust, making them suitable for holding various kitchen tools like spatulas, tongs, and whisks.",
        "The second choice is to store tools in an empty cotton swab box. Cotton swab boxes are typically small and designed to hold only small items like swabs, so they would not be practical for most kitchen tools.",
        "Given the size and typical use of the two containers, an empty baby wipe container is more appropriate for storing larger and more numerous kitchen tools compared to a cotton swab box.",
        "Therefore, the best option for adding extra storage for kitchen tools is to store them in an empty baby wipe container.",
        "Conclusion: The correct answer is A: Store tools in empty baby wipe container."
