    "steps": [
        "When at a beach, valuables may attract attention and are at risk of being stolen.",
        "Leaving everything out on your towel with a sign that says \"do not touch\" does not provide any actual deterrent to thieves.",
        "Thieves may ignore signs and exploit the opportunity if valuables are left in plain sight.",
        "Wrapping valuables in a clean diaper and rolling it up to make it look used creates a disguise that is likely to deter thieves.",
        "A used-looking diaper is less likely to be disturbed or stolen, as people generally avoid touching such items.",
        "Thus, concealing valuables in a clean diaper effectively hides them and reduces the chance of theft.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: wrap everything in a clean diaper, roll it up so that it looks used."
