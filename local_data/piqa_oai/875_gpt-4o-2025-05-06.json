    "steps": [
        "First, assess the problem: there is a cracked light bulb stuck in a socket. This can be dangerous because the glass pieces might cause injury and the remaining part of the bulb may be difficult to grasp and turn.",
        "Traditionally, an easy and safe method to remove broken light bulbs is needed. Using a potato is commonly recommended because it is soft enough to push into the socket without shattering the remaining glass further, and it provides enough grip to allow the piece to be unscrewed.",
        "Since the goal is to use the potato to grip the broken bulb, a full potato might be too large and cumbersome to maneuver around the broken pieces sticking out of the socket. It would be difficult to fit into the socket opening and create the necessary contact with the broken bulb base.",
        "Cutting the potato in half provides a flat surface to press against the bulb base, allowing for a better grip and more effective turning motion. This half-potato method ensures a better fit and wedge into the socket.",
        "Clearly, the correct method, considering both effectiveness and safety, is to place a half potato over the bulb and unscrew both. Thus, option A is correct."
