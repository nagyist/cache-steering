    "steps": [
        "First, understand what the task involves: making a new bottom for a kitchen drawer.",
        "A bottomless drawer frame has to be placed on a piece of plywood to mark the necessary dimensions. The marked dimensions are important for the new bottom to fit properly.",
        "Next, consider which dimensions need to be marked for the new drawer bottom to fit correctly. If you mark the inside of the drawer frame, the bottom will likely be too small because it won't cover the exterior edges.",
        "Instead, if you mark the outside of the drawer frame, the piece of plywood should match the entire perimeter of the frame.",
        "After marking the outside dimensions on the plywood, cutting this marked area will produce a piece that fits the bottom of the frame.",
        "Finally, nailing or attaching the cut plywood to the bottom of the drawer frame will complete the task of creating a new drawer bottom.",
        "Given these steps, the most accurate approach is described in choice A.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A."
