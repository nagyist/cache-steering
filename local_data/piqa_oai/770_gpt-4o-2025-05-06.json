    "steps": [
        "To make an air freshener, the key concept is to have a way for the scent to escape and fill the car.",
        "If the jar is airtight, the scent will be trapped inside the jar, defeating the purpose of an air freshener.",
        "By poking holes in the lid, it allows the scent to escape when the wax heats up from the sun.",
        "Therefore, option A correctly explains the process of making an air freshener as it specifies creating holes in the lid to let the scent out, unlike option B which makes the jar airtight.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: In a screw on jar, place small scented candles or wax from old candles, poke holes in top of lid, then when car heats up from the hot sun, the wax will emit odor."
