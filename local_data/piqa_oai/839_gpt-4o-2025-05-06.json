    "question": "To make butter icing.\n\nChoices:\nA: First you need to put your butter into a bowl and and gradually add the icing sugar until all of it in mixed in. Now the mixture, so far, should look crumbly this is when you should add the water so that the icing will stick together. The icing will be done when it is a very dark yellow.\nB: First you need to put your butter into a bowl and and gradually add the icing sugar until all of it in mixed in. Now the mixture, so far, should look crumbly this is when you should add the water so that the icing will stick together. The icing will be done when it is a very pale yellow.",
    "steps": [
        "To solve this question, we start by analyzing both given choices.",
        "Both choices A and B have identical steps initially: putting the butter into a bowl, adding icing sugar gradually, and observing a crumbly mixture before adding water.",
        "Next, we observe the final step in each choice, which specifies the expected color of the icing when it is done. Choice A mentions a very dark yellow, while Choice B mentions a very pale yellow.",
        "Considering our knowledge of making butter icing, the color of the properly mixed icing should indeed be pale yellow due to the light coloration of both butter and icing sugar when combined.",
        "This reasoning leads us to conclude that Choice B accurately describes the correct process and expected outcome of making butter icing.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B."
