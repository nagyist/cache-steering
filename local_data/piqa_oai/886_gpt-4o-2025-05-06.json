    "question": "To ensure balloon doesn't tear when using it to protect iPod in pool.\n\nChoices:\nA: Reuse the same balloon until the chlorine degrades the latex.\nB: Use a new balloon each time because chlorine degrades latex.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the environment in which the balloon will be used: in a pool. Pools often contain chlorine to keep the water clean and sanitary.",
        "Chlorine is a chemical that can degrade certain materials, including latex, which is commonly used to make balloons.",
        "Repeated exposure to chlorine will cause the latex to weaken over time, increasing the risk of the balloon tearing.",
        "If the balloon tears, it will no longer be able to protect the iPod from water damage.",
        "To avoid this risk, it is better to use a new balloon each time, as a fresh balloon will be at its strongest and less likely to tear.",
        "Therefore, the best choice to ensure the balloon doesn't tear is to use a new one each time.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Use a new balloon each time because chlorine degrades latex."
