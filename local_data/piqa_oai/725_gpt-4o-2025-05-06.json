        "First, identify the essential steps required for making instant coffee. These steps generally include heating water and then mixing it with instant coffee powder.",
        "Next, evaluate the methods provided in the choices for heating the water. For instant coffee, using a microwave to heat the water is a common and convenient method.",
        "Choice A suggests heating the water in a microwave for 1.5 minutes, which is plausible and efficient for quickly obtaining hot water.",
        "Choice B suggests heating the water in an oven for 1.5 minutes. Ovens are not typically used to heat small quantities of water quickly because they use different mechanisms (such as convection) that are less efficient for this purpose and can be unsafe for microwave-safe mugs.",
        "Considering these points, Choice A is both practical and safe for making instant coffee.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is: A: Heat up a mug full of water for 1.5 minutes in the microwave. Then add a tablespoon of instant coffee mix and stir with the spoon."
