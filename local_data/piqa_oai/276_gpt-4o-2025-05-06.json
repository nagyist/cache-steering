    "question": "What should you use to loosen a rusted bolt?\n\nChoices:\nA: An application of water could cause it to slip and loosen.\nB: A heat gun could cause it to expand and loosen.",
    "steps": [
        "Rusted bolts are often stuck due to the oxidation process that causes the metal to become tightly adhered. Using a method that changes the physical properties of the bolt can help to loosen it.",
        "Applying water to a rusted bolt likely won't help because water can cause further rust and make the bolt more difficult to remove.",
        "Heating the bolt with a heat gun can cause the metal to expand. As the bolt expands, it may break the rust bonds, making it easier to loosen and remove.",
        "Therefore, using a heat gun to apply heat to the bolt is a more effective method for loosening a rusted bolt.",
        "Given the choices and the reasoning above, the correct answer is B: A heat gun could cause it to expand and loosen."

    "solution": "B"
