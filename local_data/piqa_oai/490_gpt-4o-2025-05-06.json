    "steps": [
        "To hang upper cabinets without having to hold their full weight, it helps to have a stable support structure. This allows you to rest the cabinet on the support while you secure it, rather than holding the full weight.",
        "The first step involves making a mark where you want the bottom of the cabinets to go. This provides a reference point for the placement of the support structure.",
        "Using a level to draw a straight line across the wall ensures the cabinets will hang evenly, which is crucial for proper installation.",
        "Attaching a 2x4 with its top edge even with the line you've drawn provides a sturdy temporary support for the cabinets.",
        "Resting the bottom of the cabinets on the 2x4 while you screw them into place helps you to avoid holding their full weight, making the process easier and more accurate.",
        "Option B suggests using a piece of paper to draw the line, which is less reliable and precise compared to using a level.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Make a mark where you want the bottom of the cabinets to go. Use a level to draw a straight line across the wall. Place the top edge of a 2x4 even with the line, screw into place. Rest the bottom of the cabinets on the 2x4 while you screw into place."
