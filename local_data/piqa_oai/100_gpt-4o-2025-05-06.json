    "question": "Prevent bread from getting soggy in cooler.\n\nChoices:\nA: Wrap sandwiches in newspaper.\nB: Wrap sandwiches in foil.",
    "steps": [
        "Think about the properties of newspaper. Newspaper is porous and can absorb moisture.",
        "Consider the properties of foil. Foil is non-porous and creates a moisture-resistant barrier.",
        "Determine the goal: preventing bread from getting soggy. Moisture resistance is key to achieving this goal.",
        "Therefore, wrapping sandwiches in foil will better prevent them from getting soggy compared to wrapping them in newspaper.",
        "Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is B: Wrap sandwiches in foil."
