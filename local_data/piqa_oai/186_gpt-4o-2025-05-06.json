    "question": "To prepare yeast.\n\nChoices:\nA: In a medium colander combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit until foamy (takes about 5-10 minutes).\nB: In a medium bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit until foamy (takes about 5-10 minutes).",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the task described in the question, which is to prepare yeast.",
        "Next, analyze the choices provided. Both choices include combining yeast, sugar, and water and letting it sit until foamy, which is a common method in preparing yeast.",
        "The key difference between the choices is the type of container used: a colander in option A, and a bowl in option B.",
        "A colander is typically used for draining liquids and would not be appropriate for mixing ingredients that need to stay contained without draining.",
        "A bowl, on the other hand, is ideal for mixing and allowing the yeast to sit and become foamy.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: In a medium bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit until foamy (takes about 5-10 minutes)."
