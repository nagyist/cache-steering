    "steps": [
        "Consider the objective: Save time while watching the video.",
        "If the video playback speed is slower than original (choice A), it would take a longer time to watch the entire video.",
        "If the video playback speed is faster than original (choice B), it would reduce the time taken to watch the entire video.",
        "Doubling the speed (choice B) cuts the viewing time in half, thus saving time.",
        "Since the goal is to save time, choice B (speed the playback of the video up to twice the speed) is the correct answer."
