Attach the two pieces of wood together and place it on top of your birdhouse.\nB: Take two pieces of wood and a glue gun and apply glue to all sides of a piece of wood. Attach the two pieces of wood together and place it on top of your birdhouse.",
    "steps": [
        "To make a birdhouse roof, you need to attach two pieces of wood to create a roof structure.",
        "Since you are creating a roof, you typically only need to glue one side of each piece of wood to attach them together to form a peak or sloped structure.",
        "Gluing all sides of the wood would not make sense for a simple roof construction because you don't need to glue the edges that are not joining together.",
        "Therefore, the correct procedure is to take two pieces of wood, apply glue to one side of each piece, attach them together, and place them on top of the birdhouse.",
        "This matches choice A."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
