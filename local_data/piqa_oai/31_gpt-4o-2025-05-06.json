    "steps": [
        "Understanding what a French manicure is essential in answering the question accurately.",
        "A French manicure typically involves painting the tip of the nail with a white or light-colored polish while the rest of the nail remains a natural or nude color.",
        "Since the defining feature of a French manicure is the contrast between the painted tip and the rest of the nail, the correct technique would be to only paint the tip.",
