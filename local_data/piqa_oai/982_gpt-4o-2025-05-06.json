    "steps": [
        "When mopping floors, it is essential to use a mixture that can effectively clean the surface. Cleaners are designed to remove dirt and grime.",
        "Oil, on the other hand, can make the floor slippery and potentially more difficult to clean, as it leaves a residue rather than removing dirt.",
        "Therefore, the most effective and safe way to mop a floor is using a cleaner mixed with water, as this combination will help lift and remove dirt from the floor.",
        "Given the choices, the correct answer involves using a cleaner and water mixture, as stated in choice A.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: Spread a little cleaner and water mixture onto the floor and mop it all around."
