Coil the free end of one rope twice around the second rope and pass it back through the inside of the coils.    Repeat with second rope in opposite direction\nB: Lay the ends of three lines parallel to each other.    Coil the free end of one rope twice around the second rope and pass it back through the inside of the coils.    Repeat with second rope in opposite direction and then third in same direction",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify what a Double Fisherman's Knot is used for. It is primarily used to tie two ropes together securely.",
        "Next, evaluate the number of ropes involved in tying a Double Fisherman's Knot. It typically involves the ends of two ropes.",
        "Given the choices, the difference between option A and option B is the number of ropes involved. Option A uses the ends of two lines, while option B incorrectly involves the ends of three lines.",
        "The correct process for tying a Double Fisherman's Knot involves coiling the free end of one rope twice around the second rope and passing it back through the inside of the coils, and repeating this with the second rope in the opposite direction.",
        "Thus, the correct answer to how to tie a Double Fisherman's Knot is option A: Lay the ends of two lines parallel to each other. Coil the free end of one rope twice around the second rope and pass it back through the inside of the coils. Repeat with the second rope in the opposite direction."
