    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct way to attach two pieces of wood together, we need to consider the effectiveness and suitability of the adhesive options provided.",
        "Glue sticks are generally used in hot glue guns and are suitable for crafts or temporary fixes. They don't provide a strong or durable bond for wood.",
        "Gorilla glue is a polyurethane adhesive that is specifically designed for strong bonds with materials such as wood. It expands as it dries, creating a strong connection.",
        "Holding the wood in clamps while the glue dries ensures even pressure, which helps in creating a strong bond.",
        "Based on these considerations, gorilla glue is more appropriate for attaching two pieces of wood together.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Use gorilla glue and hold the wood in clamps while it dries."
