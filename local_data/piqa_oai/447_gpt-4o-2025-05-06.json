    "question": "How can I keep sodas cool at a picnic?\n\nChoices:\nA: Pack a cooler with ice to put the sodas into for the outdoors.\nB: Pack a box with ice to put the sodas into for the outdoors.",
    "steps": [
        "Identify the main goal of the question: keeping sodas cool at a picnic.",
        "Evaluate the choices given to determine which one will be the most effective for maintaining a low temperature for the sodas.",
        "Choice A suggests using a cooler, which is specifically designed for insulation and keeping items cold.",
        "Choice B suggests using a box with ice, but it doesn't specify the type of box. Ordinary boxes may not provide adequate insulation, causing the ice to melt faster and thus not keeping the sodas cool for a prolonged period.",
        "Comparing both choices, a cooler (choice A) is explicitly made to keep items cold and would be most effective in maintaining the desired temperature for the sodas.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Pack a cooler with ice to put the sodas into for the outdoors."
