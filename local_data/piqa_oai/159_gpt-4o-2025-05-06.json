    "steps": [
        "When making a beef and bourbon pie, it is important to properly cool down the meat filling to ensure food safety and proper texture for the pie.",
        "The refrigerator is a device specifically designed for cooling and storing food safely at a temperature that prevents bacterial growth.",
        "Placing the filling in a bowl and then covering it in the refrigerator overnight (Choice A) ensures that the meat filling is cooled down efficiently and safely. Covering the filling also prevents it from drying out and absorbing any unwanted odors from the refrigerator.",
        "On the other hand, placing the filling in a bowl and then in the nail (Choice B) does not make practical or logical sense. \"In the nail\" is an incorrect phrase and doesn't refer to a method of cooling food.",
        "Therefore, Choice A is the correct method to cool down the meat filling overnight in a safe and effective manner."
