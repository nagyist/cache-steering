    "steps": [
        "First, we must identify that cleaning asphalt typically involves removing dirt, grime, and possibly stains that have embedded into the rough surface.",
        "Second, a solution needs to be applied to the asphalt surface, which will help in loosening the dirt and grime. Pouring the solution directly over the asphalt ensures better coverage and allows the cleaning agent to penetrate the surface better.",
        "Third, scrubbing the surface rigorously is necessary to effectively remove the deep-seated dirt and stains. Using a hard-bristled brush is more effective because it can apply more pressure and effectively scrub the rough surface.",
        "Considering both options, option A mentions pouring the solution over the asphalt and using a hard-bristled brush to rigorously scrub the asphalt. This approach is more effective for comprehensive cleaning, thus making it the correct answer."
