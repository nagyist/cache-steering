        "To determine which choice helps in training a dog to go to the bathroom outside, we need to focus on actions that encourage outdoor bathroom behavior.",
        "Choice A suggests taking the dog indoors more or leaving him inside longer, which does not directly create the opportunity for the dog to go outside to go to the bathroom.",
        "Choice B suggests taking the dog outdoors more or leaving him outside longer, which naturally gives the dog more opportunities to go to the bathroom outside.",
        "Additionally, giving treats as a reward for going to the bathroom outside is a positive reinforcement technique that encourages this behavior.",
