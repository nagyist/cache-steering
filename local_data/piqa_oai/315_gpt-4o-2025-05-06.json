        "Firstly, you need to consider the physical characteristics of the brown recluse spider, which include its color and the number of eyes.",
        "The color description of choice A and choice B both state that the brown recluse spider can be brown, tan, light brown or even whitish in color. This characteristic is generally in line with descriptions provided by various sources, such as entomology websites and spider identification guides. Therefore, either choice could be correct based on color alone.",
        "Next, focus on the number of eyes. Most spiders typically have 8 eyes, not 16. This information can be confirmed by looking at general characteristics of spiders from reputable sources.",
        "Choice A mistakenly states that most spiders have 16 eyes, which is incorrect.",
        "Choice B correctly states that most spiders have 8 eyes.",
        "The statement in choice B that the brown recluse spider has 6 eyes correctly identifies a unique feature of the spider.",
        "Based on the accurate depiction of the number of eyes in choice B, choice B is the correct answer."
