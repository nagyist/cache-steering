    "steps": [
        "First, let's understand the primary use of a saw. A saw is a tool that is designed to cut through materials like wood, metal, or plastic, typically in a straight line.",
        "Next, let's evaluate each option in the context of what a saw can do.",
        "Option A: comb. Combs are typically made of plastic or metal and are relatively small and intricate. Using a saw to shred a comb is impractical and not typically the purpose of a saw.",
        "Option B: mittens. Mittens are usually made of fabric or wool. A saw could theoretically be used to cut through or shred mittens, although it might not be the most efficient tool for the job. However, in comparison with Option A, this option is slightly more viable given the material involved.",
        "Given the context and typical uses of a saw, while neither option is ideal, B makes slightly more sense than A as it deals with materials more plausibly handled by a saw.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: can be used to shred mittens to make pillow stuffing."
