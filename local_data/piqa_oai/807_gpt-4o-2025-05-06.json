    "question": "How can I secure the top of the trash bag so it doesn't fall into the dust bin?\n\nChoices:\nA: Place picture hanger hooks on the bottom of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those.\nB: Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for securing the top of the trash bag so it doesn't fall into the dust bin, we start by examining the two given choices.",
        "The first choice involves placing picture hanger hooks on the bottom of the can and hooking the handles of the trash bag inside those. This would not help secure the bag at the top, and it would be difficult to keep the bag upright if it's secured from the bottom.",
        "The second choice involves placing picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hooking the handles of the trash bag inside those. Securing the handles on the outside of the trash can will keep the bag stable and prevent it from falling into the can.",
        "Since the objective is to secure the top of the trash bag, the sensible option is to place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can to hook the handles of the trash bag, which aligns with the requirement.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Place picture hanger hooks on the outside of the can and hook the handles of the trash bag inside those."
