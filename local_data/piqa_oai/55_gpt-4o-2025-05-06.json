    "question": "To empty a bagless vacuum cleaner without mess\n\nChoices:\nA: To prevent a mess when emptying a bagless vacuum cleaner, remove the barrel from the cleaner using the deploy button, take a big bin liner and wrap it over the bottom of the chamber and half-way up the chamber itself. Press the chamber open button and gently tap and shake the chamber so all the dirt falls into the bag. If some of it stays inside, use chopsticks or a wooden spoon to dislodge it into the bag. Replace the chamber and tie the bag off.\nB: To prevent a mess when emptying a bagless vacuum cleaner, remove the barrel from the cleaner using the deploy button, take a big bin liner and wrap it over the top of the chamber and half-way down the chamber itself.

    "steps": [
        "Identify the objective, which is to empty a bagless vacuum cleaner without making a mess.",
        "Compare both choices to determine which one logically achieves a cleaner disposal of dirt.",
        "The key difference between the two choices is the positioning of the bin liner in relation to the vacuum chamber.",
        "Choice A suggests wrapping the bin liner over the bottom and halfway up the chamber, while Choice B suggests wrapping it over the top and halfway down the chamber.",
        "Wrapping the bin liner over the bottom means the opening where the dirt exits will be inside the bag. Therefore, when the chamber is opened, the dirt will fall directly into the bag, minimizing mess.",
        "Wrapping the bin liner over the top of the chamber means the dirt may not directly fall into the bag and could spill around it. This increases the chances of creating a mess.",
        "By comparing these details, Choice A clearly shows a more effective way to prevent mess during the emptying process.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is Choice A."
