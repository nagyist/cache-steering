    "question": "To open a pickle jar when it is stuck.\n\nChoices:\nA: Take a paint brush and grip the lid when you twist. This will make it loosen and come off.\nB: Take a shirt and grip the lid when you twist. This will make it loosen and come off.",
    "steps": [
        "First, evaluate the purpose and practicality of using a paint brush to open a stuck pickle jar lid. The bristles of a paint brush are soft and flexible, i.e., lacking in grip strength needed to loosen a tight lid.",
        "Next, consider the practicality of using a shirt to open a stuck pickle jar lid. Fabric from a shirt can provide a better grip due to its texture, thus increasing friction between the hand and the lid when twisting.",
        "Compare both choices in terms of their effectiveness in providing grip. The shirt demonstrates a clear advantage as it helps to securely grip the lid and apply more torque during twisting.",
        "Conclude the analysis by determining that using a shirt is indeed more practical and effective for loosening and opening a stuck pickle jar lid.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Take a shirt and grip the lid when you twist. This will make it loosen and come off."
