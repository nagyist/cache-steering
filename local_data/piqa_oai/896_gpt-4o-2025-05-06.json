    "question": "duct tape\n\nChoices:\nA: can patch shoe hole\nB: can store shoe easily",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the primary functions of duct tape.",
        "Duct tape is known for its strong adhesive properties and durability.",
        "One of the common uses for duct tape is repairing items temporarily because it can hold things together.",
        "Patching a hole in a shoe would require a strong adhesive and durable material to hold the shoe together and cover the hole, which duct tape is capable of doing.",
        "Storing a shoe easily does not relate to the adhesive properties of duct tape, nor is duct tape typically used for storage purposes.",
        "Given this reasoning, the choice \"A: can patch shoe hole\" is the most appropriate answer."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
