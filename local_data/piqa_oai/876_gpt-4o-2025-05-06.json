    "question": "When doing on a woodworking project, why is it a good idea to boil the wood?\n\nChoices:\nA: To keep it flexible, therefore insuring a longer period of time to work.\nB: To melt the wood into wooden liquid juice in case you get thirsty.",
    "steps": [
        "Wood in its natural state may be too rigid for certain woodworking projects.",
        "Flexibility in wood can be achieved through a process called boiling, which helps soften the wood fibers.",
        "This increased flexibility allows for easier manipulation and shaping during the woodworking process.",
        "Boiling wood can help ensure that it remains workable for a longer period of time.",
        "Option B, \u201cTo melt the wood into wooden liquid juice in case you get thirsty,\u201d is not a practical nor scientifically sound reason. Wood cannot be melted into juice.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: To keep it flexible, therefore insuring a longer period of time to work."
