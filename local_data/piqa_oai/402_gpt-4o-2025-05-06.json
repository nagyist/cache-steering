    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze both options in regard to how alcohol affects the body during a flight.",
        "Option A states that alcohol inebriates you and makes it harder to get REM sleep. It suggests that alcohol calms nerves short term but results in exhaustion and grogginess upon arrival.",
        "Option B states that alcohol dehydrates you and makes it harder to get REM sleep. Similar to Option A, it mentions that alcohol calms nerves short term but leads to exhaustion and grogginess upon arrival.",
        "The key point to focus on is staying hydrated during the flight. It is widely known that alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body, which is especially problematic in the already dehydrating environment of an airplane.",
        "Given this focus, Option B correctly highlights the dehydration effect of alcohol, which is particularly relevant for staying hydrated during a flight.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Alcohol dehydrates you and makes it harder to get REM sleep, so while it might calm the nerves short term, it\u2019s going to make you that much more exhausted and groggy when you arrive."
