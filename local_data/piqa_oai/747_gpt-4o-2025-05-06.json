    "steps": [
        "First, identify the tools mentioned in the choices: a pool stick and a Swiffer stick.",
        "Consider the typical uses of each tool. A pool stick is used to strike billiard balls during a game of pool; it is not designed for cleaning or removing cobwebs.",
        "A Swiffer stick, on the other hand, is specifically designed for cleaning purposes. It typically comes with interchangeable cleaning pads that can be used for dusting and removing cobwebs.",
        "Understand that cobwebs are often found in the corners and edges of walls, which can be effectively reached by a cleaning tool designed for this purpose.",
        "Therefore, using a Swiffer stick would be the logical choice for efficiently and effectively removing cobwebs from walls.",
        "As a result, the correct answer to the question is B: Use a Swiffer stick."
