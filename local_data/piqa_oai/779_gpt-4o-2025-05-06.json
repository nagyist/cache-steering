    "question": "In order to grind coffee beans,\n\nChoices:\nA: pour a serving of bean into a coffee grinder, turn on and grind until it's powdery.\nB: pour a serving of bean into a coffee grinder, turn on and grind until it's moist.",
    "steps": [
        "To grind coffee beans, a coffee grinder is used.",
        "Grinding beans involves breaking them down into smaller particles.",
        "These smaller particles, commonly referred to as coffee grounds, are typically powdery and dry.",
        "Coffee grounds need to be powdery to effectively brew coffee because the powdery texture allows for more surface area for water to extract the flavor.",
        "Grinding beans until they are moist would not be suitable for brewing coffee.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is to grind the beans until they are powdery.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: pour a serving of bean into a coffee grinder, turn on and grind until it's powdery."
