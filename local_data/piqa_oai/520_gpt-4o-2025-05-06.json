    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct process for sous viding a steak, we need to understand what sous vide cooking involves.",
        "Sous vide is a method of cooking in which food is placed in a plastic bag or vacuum-sealed bag and cooked in a water bath at a precise temperature.",
        "The purpose of sous vide is to cook the food evenly, ensuring that the inside is fully cooked without overcooking the outside.",
        "Given the method described, we need to figure out whether it starts with raw or cooked steak.",
        "Raw steak placed in the sous vide bag will be gradually brought to the desired temperature throughout the cooking process.",
        "If cooked steak were placed in the sous vide bag, it would be redundant as the steak is already cooked, and further cooking could lead to overcooking.",
        "Finally, to achieve a good texture and flavor, sous vide steaks are generally seared after being cooked in the water bath to develop a crust on the outside.",
        "Considering these steps, the correct process involves placing the raw steak in the sous vide bag first, then cooking it in the water bath, and searing it afterward.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: Place the raw steak in the sous vide bag, bring the water to temperature and let it cook, then sear the steak afterward."
