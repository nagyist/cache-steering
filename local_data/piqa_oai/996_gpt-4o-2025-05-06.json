        "Consider the first step in the process described in both answer choices: using a nutcracker and holding the walnut between two fingers. This step is common to both options and is a sensible starting point for cracking a walnut.",
        "Next, both options mention placing the walnut securely in the center of the nutcracker. This is necessary for applying the appropriate pressure to crack the shell of the walnut and is also a common step mentioned in both options.",
        "The crucial difference lies in where to hold the nutcracker while cracking the walnut. Option A suggests holding the nutcracker over a bowl or a trash can, whereas Option B suggests holding the nutcracker over a fire or stovetop. It is intuitive and much safer to hold the nutcracker over a bowl or trash can, as this will catch any debris without risk.",
        "Option B, which recommends holding the nutcracker over a fire or stovetop, is not practical because there is no logical reason to crack a walnut over a potentially dangerous heat source. This could also lead to safety hazards and fire risks, which makes this option impractical.",
        "Therefore, the correct procedure is Option A. It comprises practical and safe steps: using a nutcracker properly, placing the walnut in it securely, holding it over a container to catch debris, and squeezing to crack the walnut.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is:\nA: Use a nutcracker and hold a walnut between two fingers. Open the nutcracker and place the walnut securely in the center of it. Hold the nutcracker over a bowl or a trash can to catch any debris. Squeeze the nutcracker shut in your hands until the walnut cracks."
