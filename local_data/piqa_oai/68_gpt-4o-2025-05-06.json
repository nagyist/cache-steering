    "question": "What can I do to store documents externally and privately.\n\nChoices:\nA: Upload the documents onto the web.\nB: Upload the documents onto a flash drive.",
    "steps": [
        "To store documents externally, we are looking for a method that does not involve leaving them on the internal storage of our primary device.",
        "We are also looking for a private method, meaning the documents should not be easily accessible by others unless we explicitly grant access.",
        "One option is to upload the documents onto the web. However, this involves storing documents on online servers, which might not ensure complete privacy as servers can potentially be hacked or accessed by unauthorized users.",
        "Another option is to upload the documents onto a flash drive. A flash drive is a physical storage device that can be connected to your primary device to transfer files and then removed for external storage.",
        "Using a flash drive allows for better control over who can access the documents, as it is in a physical form that can be kept securely and privately.",
        "Therefore, the most suitable option to store documents externally and privately is to upload the documents onto a flash drive."
