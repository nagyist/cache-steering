        "To obtain a bachelor's degree, you typically need to enroll in and complete a college program that offers bachelor's degrees. This usually involves completing a set number of credits that include general education subjects as well as courses specific to your chosen major.",
        "An associate's degree is often a stepping stone to a bachelor's degree. An associate's degree usually requires two years of study, and the credits earned can often be transferred to a bachelor's degree program.",
        "A master's degree is a higher-level degree that typically requires you to first complete a bachelor's degree. Therefore, you cannot directly pursue a master's degree before obtaining a bachelor's degree.",
        "Given the choices, going back to college after you get your associate's degree (Choice B) is the correct path to earning a bachelor's degree because it aligns with the usual academic progression."
