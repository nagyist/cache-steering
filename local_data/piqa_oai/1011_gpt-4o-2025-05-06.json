    "steps": [
        "First, consider the goal: to make a painted projector screen. This involves preparing a surface and applying materials that enhance projection quality.",
        "Next, evaluate the materials suggested in choice A. Epoxy and mica additives are not commonly associated with projector screens, which typically need specific types of paint for optimal reflection and color.",
        "Consider choice B which suggests finding the right paint first, which aligns with standard practices for creating projector screens that require special paints designed for high reflectivity and smooth surfaces.",
        "Continue by following the logical sequence in choice B: painting the wall first to prepare a suitable base, then applying the screen paint to create an even and reflective screen surface.",
        "Finally, adding a simple frame helps to define the screen area and improve viewing aesthetics, which is a practical finishing touch.",
        "Thus, the steps in choice B (finding the right paint, painting the wall, painting the screen, and adding a simple frame) directly address the project's requirements without the unnecessary complexity of epoxy and mica additives.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Find the right paint. Paint the wall. Paint the screen. Add a simple frame."
