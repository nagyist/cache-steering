    "question": "How can I make a criss-cross design on my peanut butter cookies.\n\nChoices:\nA: Take a tablespoon of cookie dough and roll it into a ball, place the cookie on a baking sheet and use the bottom a glass to flatten the ball, then take a cross pendant that you might have and press it one way into the cookie and then repeat in the opposite direction for the criss-cross design.\nB: Take a tablespoon of cookie dough and roll it into a ball, place the cookie on a baking sheet and use the bottom a glass to flatten the ball, then take a fork and press it one way into the cookie and then repeat in the opposite direction for the criss-cross design.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the necessary steps for creating a criss-cross design on peanut butter cookies.",
        "Rolling the cookie dough into a ball and flattening it is common for making peanut butter cookies, so both options seem plausible so far.",
        "Next, consider the tools used to create the design. A fork is a common baking tool, often used to make criss-cross patterns on peanut butter cookies.",
        "Compare the practicality of using a fork versus using a cross pendant. A fork is generally more accessible and practical for making uniform lines compared to a pendant.",
        "Based on traditional methods and practicality, it is more common and practical to use a fork.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Take a tablespoon of cookie dough and roll it into a ball, place the cookie on a baking sheet and use the bottom a glass to flatten the ball, then take a fork and press it one way into the cookie and then repeat in the opposite direction for the criss-cross design."
