    "question": "how do you get rid of bags under your eyes?\n\nChoices:\nA: freeze a spoon and then hold it under your eye for twenty minutes.\nB: put concealer over them.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to determine what causes bags under the eyes. Bags under the eyes are typically caused by factors such as aging, fatigue, fluid retention, and lack of sleep.",
        "Cold temperatures can help reduce swelling and inflammation by constricting blood vessels and decreasing fluid accumulation, which is one of the reasons using something cold, like a frozen spoon, can help with bags under the eyes.",
        "Option A suggests freezing a spoon and then holding it under the eye for twenty minutes. The cold spoon will help reduce the swelling and inflammation, which in turn should diminish the appearance of bags under the eyes.",
        "Option B suggests using concealer to cover them up. While concealer can hide the appearance of bags under the eyes, it does not actually get rid of them.",
        "Therefore, option A is an effective way to actually address the problem by reducing swelling and inflammation, whereas option B only masks the symptoms.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: freeze a spoon and then hold it under your eye for twenty minutes."
