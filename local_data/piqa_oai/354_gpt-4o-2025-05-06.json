        "To determine how to make two quarts of sun tea, we need to consider the method needed to brew the tea using sunlight.",
        "First, we need to check the given choices A and B and see which one fits the method for making sun tea.",
        "Choice A states putting 4 tea bags into an open two quart glass container, filling it with water and placing it outside for the sunlight to hit it for about 3 to 5 hours.",
        "Choice B states putting 4 tea bags into a two quart glass container, filling it with water, and capping it, then placing it outside for the sunlight to hit it for about 3 to 5 hours.",
        "While both choices include similar steps such as adding the tea bags, filling the container with water, and placing it outside in the sunlight for the same amount of time, the main difference is whether the container is open or capped.",
        "Capping the container (Choice B) is the standard method, as it ensures the tea stays clean and free from contaminants like dust or insects while it brews in the sunlight.",
        "An open container (Choice A) could lead to tea becoming contaminated with external particles.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice based on the standard method for making two quarts of sun tea is B: Put 4 tea bags into a two quart glass container, fill with water and cap. Place outside where the sunlight can hit the container for about 3 to 5 hours."
