        "To determine the correct method for making light creamed corn, we need to consider several important factors including the quantity of ingredients and the steps involved in the process.",
        "First, we look at the number of ears of corn used. The choice A states \"600 raw ears of corn,\" which is highly impractical and excessive for a typical recipe.",
        "Choice B indicates using \"6 raw ears of corn,\" which is a reasonable amount for cooking and consistent with typical homemade recipes.",
        "Next, we analyze the steps in the recipe. Both choices involve cutting the kernels off the ears of corn, scraping the cobs to extract milk, and pureeing half of the kernels with water.",
        "Both also suggest cooking the remaining kernels with onion in butter until soft, then adding the puree and seasoning with salt and pepper, followed by simmering for 10 minutes.",
        "Given the unrealistic quantity of corn in choice A and the practical steps and ingredients in choice B, the correct answer is clearly choice B.",
        "Thus, the accurate method to make light creamed corn is described in choice B: \"Cut the kernels off 6 raw ears of corn. Scrape the cobs with the back of a knife to extract the milk; puree the milk with half of the kernels and 1 cup water. Cook the remaining kernels and 1/2 chopped onion in 2 tablespoons butter until soft. Add the puree, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, stirring, 10 minutes.\""
