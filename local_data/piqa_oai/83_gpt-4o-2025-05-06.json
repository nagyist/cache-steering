    "question": "To determine if a wound needs stitches,\n\nChoices:\nA: they are needed if the wound is more than one-quarter decimeter deep, if the edges of the wound need to be pulled together to touch, or if the wound is on a part of the body that moves a lot or on the face.\nB: they are needed if the wound is more than one-quarter inch deep, if the edges of the wound need to be pulled together to touch, or if the wound is on a part of the body that moves a lot or on the face.",
    "steps": [
        "This question is about determining when a wound requires stitches.",
        "First, let's clarify the measurements given in the choices.",
        "In choice A, \"one-quarter decimeter\" is equal to 2.5 cm (since 1 decimeter = 10 cm).",
        "In choice B, \"one-quarter inch\" is equal to approximately 0.635 cm.",
        "Medical guidelines generally state that stitches are needed for wounds that are deeper than 0.635 cm (or approximately 1/4 inch).",
        "Both choices mention conditions regarding wound edges needing to be pulled together and the location of the wound (on parts of the body that move a lot or on the face), which are both accurate considerations for requiring stitches.",
        "Given that the accurate medical guideline matches choice B's measurement (one-quarter inch), choice B is correct.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: they are needed if the wound is more than one-quarter inch deep, if the edges of the wound need to be pulled together to touch, or if the wound is on a part of the body that moves a lot or on the face."
