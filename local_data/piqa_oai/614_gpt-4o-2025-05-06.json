    "question": "To change the color of a metal ring, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Place the ring on a piece of wire and heat the ring with a leaf blower in short bursts\nB: Place the ring on a piece of wire and heat the ring with a blowtorch in short bursts",
    "steps": [
        "To change the color of a metal ring through heating, a sufficient amount of heat needs to be applied to invoke a chemical reaction or physical change in the metal.",
        "A leaf blower generally produces a stream of air at ambient temperature or slightly above, but does not provide the intense heat necessary to change the color of a metal ring.",
        "A blowtorch, however, produces a high-temperature flame that can heat the metal ring sufficiently in short bursts to cause a change in color.",
        "Therefore, to effectively change the color of a metal ring, using a blowtorch is the correct method."
