    "question": "How can I make an origami paper fan?\n\nChoices:\nA: Using a standard sheet of paper, fold about 1 inch of the paper up from the bottom, flip the paper to the other side and fold about 1 inch up again, making sure the edges line up at the bottom, repeat until you run out of paper to fold.\nB: Using a standard bed sheet, fold about 1 inch of the paper up from the bottom, flip the sheet to the other side and fold about 1 inch up again, making sure the edges line up at the bottom, repeat until you run out of sheet to fold.",
    "steps": [
        "To identify the correct choice for making an origami paper fan, we need to determine which material is appropriate for this craft.",
        "Origami traditionally uses paper, as it is easy to fold and holds the creases well.",
        "On the other hand, a bed sheet is not suitable for origami due to its size, texture, and inability to hold sharp creases.",
        "Therefore, the correct material to use in making an origami paper fan is indeed paper.",
        "Option A mentions using a standard sheet of paper and describes the step-by-step folding process needed to create the fan.",
        "Option B incorrectly suggests using a bed sheet, which is impractical for origami.",
        "Hence, the correct choice is A: Using a standard sheet of paper, fold about 1 inch of the paper up from the bottom, flip the paper to the other side and fold about 1 inch up again, making sure the edges line up at the bottom, repeat until you run out of paper to fold."
