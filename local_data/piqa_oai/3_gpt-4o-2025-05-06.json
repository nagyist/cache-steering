    "steps": [
        "First, consider the definition of 'shake'.",
        "Shaking generally refers to a rapid, abrupt motion involving multiple directions.",
        "Evaluate option A: \"move it up and down and side to side quickly.\"",
        "Moving something up and down and side to side quickly aligns with the typical concept of shaking as it involves rapid and multi-directional movement.",
        "Evaluate option B: \"stir it very quickly.\"",
        "Stirring generally refers to rotating or mixing in circles, which does not align with the common interpretation of shaking.",
        "Based on the definitions and the specific motions described, the correct choice that matches the concept of shaking is Option A.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: move it up and down and side to side quickly."
