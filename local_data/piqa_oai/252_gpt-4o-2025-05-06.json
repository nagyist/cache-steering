    "question": "To prevent chance of a oil boilover and subsequent fire during deep frying a turkey\n\nChoices:\nA: The turkey MUST be completely defrozen.\nB: The turkey MUST be completely frozen.",
    "steps": [
        "One risk associated with deep frying a turkey is the chance of oil boilover, which can occur if the turkey is not properly prepared.",
        "A key step in preparing the turkey is ensuring it is completely defrozen, as a frozen turkey can cause oil to boil over when submerged.",
        "Oil boilover happens because ice or water from a frozen turkey rapidly interacts with the hot oil, causing violent bubbling and the oil to overflow.",
        "This overflow can lead to a fire hazard because the hot oil can ignite if it comes into contact with the flame or heat source.",
        "Therefore, to prevent a chance of oil boilover and subsequent fire during deep frying, the turkey must be completely defrozen.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: The turkey MUST be completely defrozen."
