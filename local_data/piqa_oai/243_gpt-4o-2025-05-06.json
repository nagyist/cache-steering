    "question": "Tell when there was a drought by looking at a tree slice.\n\nChoices:\nA: Look at the tree slice and look for the smaller rings. These years are when there was drought.\nB: Look at the tree slice and look for the smaller rings that have no water. These years are when there was drought.",
    "steps": [
        "Tree rings reflect the growth conditions of each year. Wood formation in trees occurs once a year, creating a new ring annually.",
        "During favorable conditions like adequate rainfall, the tree grows more, resulting in wider rings. Conversely, in adverse conditions such as drought, the tree grows less, resulting in narrower rings.",
        "Thus, smaller rings on a tree slice indicate years where there was less growth, likely due to drought conditions.",
        "Option A suggests looking for smaller rings on the tree slice to identify years of drought.",
        "Option B mentions smaller rings having no water. However, tree rings are not characterized by containing water or not; they represent growth increments.",
        "Given this explanation, the correct answer is A: Look at the tree slice and look for the smaller rings. These years are when there was drought."
