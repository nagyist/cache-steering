        "Start by understanding what Braille is: Braille is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired.",
        "Each Braille character or \"cell\" is composed of up to six raised dots arranged in a 2x3 grid.",
        "Reading Braille involves feeling these raised dots with one's fingertips.",
        "Option A suggests counting the dots to make out the letters, but in practice, Braille readers don't count dots; they recognize the pattern of the dots.",
        "Option B suggests placing your fingers over it to make out the letters, which accurately describes the method of reading Braille through touch and pattern recognition.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: place your fingers over it to make out the letters."
