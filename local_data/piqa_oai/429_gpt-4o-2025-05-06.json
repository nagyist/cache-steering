    "question": "how to replace buttermilk\n\nChoices:\nA: use milk with a little bit of lemon juice\nB: use coconut milk and a bit of sour cream.",
    "steps": [
        "Buttermilk has a tangy flavor and acidity that is often necessary in recipes.",
        "Milk alone does not have the same acidity as buttermilk.",
        "Lemon juice can be added to milk to create the necessary acidity, mimicking the properties of buttermilk.",
        "Coconut milk has a distinct flavor that may not substitute well in recipes calling for buttermilk.",
        "Sour cream could add tang, but it has a thicker consistency and different taste.",
        "Therefore, the best substitute that closely mimics the properties of buttermilk is milk with a little bit of lemon juice."
