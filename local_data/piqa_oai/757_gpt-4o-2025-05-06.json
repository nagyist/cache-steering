    "question": "nail clipper\n\nChoices:\nA: can cut a thread off a pillow\nB: can cut a tag off a pillow",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the primary function of a nail clipper, which is to cut small objects such as nails.",
        "Think about the physical objects involved: a thread and a tag. A thread is much smaller and similar to the function nail clippers are designed for.",
        "A tag might be thicker or made of sturdier material such as plastic, which could be harder for a nail clipper to cut.",
        "Therefore, a nail clipper would be better suited for cutting something small and thin, like a thread.",
        "Based on this reasoning, the most fitting and accurate choice is A: can cut a thread off a pillow."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
