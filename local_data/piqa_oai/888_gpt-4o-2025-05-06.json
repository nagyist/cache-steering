    "question": "People\n\nChoices:\nA: can cook humans quickly\nB: can cook meth quickly",
    "steps": [
        "Start by analyzing the context of the question: it is asking about something that people can cook quickly.",
        "Choice A states \"can cook humans quickly,\" which is incorrect and inappropriate. It is not customary or ethical to cook humans. Such an action is against societal norms and laws.",
        "Choice B states \"can cook meth quickly,\" which, although illegal, refers to something humans can technically do. Methamphetamine (meth) is known to be synthetically produced and the process can be done quickly by those who engage in it.",
        "Given the options and the context within human capabilities, Choice B is the more logical answer as it is referencing an actual (albeit illegal) activity involving quick synthesis by humans.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: can cook meth quickly."

    "solution": "B"
