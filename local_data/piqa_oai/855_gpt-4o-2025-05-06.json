    "question": "To make something shiny black\n\nChoices:\nA: Spraypaint with black gloss paint\nB: Spraypaint with black matte paint",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the best way to make something shiny and black, we first need to understand the properties of the paint finishes.",
        "Gloss paint has a shiny, reflective finish that makes surfaces look sleek and polished. It is designed to reflect light, giving it a shiny appearance.",
        "Matte paint, on the other hand, has a flat, non-reflective finish. It absorbs light rather than reflecting it, resulting in a dull, non-shiny appearance.",
        "Given that we want to achieve a shiny black finish, we need a paint that has reflective qualities.",
        "Thus, using black gloss paint will provide the shiny effect we desire, while black matte paint would result in a dull surface.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is A: Spraypaint with black gloss paint."
