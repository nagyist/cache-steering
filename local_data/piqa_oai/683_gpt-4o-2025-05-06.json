    "question": "One wants to remove rust from a metal object.\n\nChoices:\nA: One should acquire saline.\nB: One should acquire fresh water.",
    "steps": [
        "Rust typically forms on metal surfaces due to oxidation, which is a reaction between iron, water, and oxygen.",
        "To remove rust, a solution is often used to dissolve the rust and make the metal surface clean again.",
        "Saline solution contains salt, which can help loosen the rust from the metal object due to its abrasive and chemical properties.",
        "Fresh water, on the other hand, does not have the same properties as saline and is not effective in removing rust.",
        "Therefore, acquiring saline is the correct choice for removing rust from a metal object."
