    "steps": [
        "To determine if something is brass or gold, we need to look at their physical properties and behaviors.",
        "Brass is an alloy made primarily of copper and zinc. It is known for its acoustic properties, meaning it can produce sound when struck.",
        "Gold, on the other hand, is a dense and soft metal that does not vibrate in the same manner as brass when struck. It will not produce a bell-like sound.",
        "Given these characteristics, striking the object and listening for a bell-like vibration is a reliable method to differentiate between brass and gold.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: A: Brass will vibrate like a bell when hit. Gold will not."
