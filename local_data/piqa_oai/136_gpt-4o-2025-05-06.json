    "steps": [
        "Consider the primary function of a sock, which is to cover the foot.",
        "Think about the shape and material of a sock; it is similar to that of a mitten in terms of covering and warmth.",
        "A sock can be worn on the hand, albeit not perfectly, to substitute for a mitten, providing some level of protection and warmth.",
        "A bowl, on the other hand, is a rigid container primarily used for holding food or liquids.",
        "A sock does not have the rigidity or capacity to hold items like a bowl, thus making it unsuitable as a cheap substitute for a bowl.",
        "Therefore, when considering its material and shape, a sock can serve as a cheap mitten when nothing else is available."
