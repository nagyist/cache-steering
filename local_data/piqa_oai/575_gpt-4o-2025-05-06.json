        "When considering how to soak white mugs, it's important to understand what the goal is: usually, the goal is to clean or remove stains from the mugs.",
        "Hydrogen peroxide is a common bleaching agent that works well for cleaning stains without damaging the material of the mug.",
        "Using soda (carbonated beverage) isn't as logical for cleaning as it doesn't have the same properties as hydrogen peroxide for stain removal.",
        "Warm water is generally used to help dissolve and activate cleaning agents, making it an effective choice for combining with hydrogen peroxide.",
        "Given these points, soaking the mugs in warm water with hydrogen peroxide is more likely to achieve the desired cleaning effect compared to using soda.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Soak mugs in container with warm water and 2 tbsp of hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes."
