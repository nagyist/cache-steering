    "question": "How can we make a mobile charging station?\n\nChoices:\nA: You get a shampoo bottle and make two holes, one hole needs to be big enough for the plug in part to fit and one hole needs to be able to hold your cellphone while it is hanging.\nB: You get an empty shampoo bottle, you clean it out and make a hole on one side, big enough for the plug in part to fit, then you make another hole big enough to hold your phone.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to identify the elements necessary to make a mobile charging station from a shampoo bottle.",
        "We require an empty shampoo bottle. Thus, we first ensure the bottle is empty and clean it out.",
        "Next, we need to create spaces for both the plug and the phone. Hence, we make two holes.",
        "One hole must be big enough for the plug to fit through so it can attach to the socket.",
        "The other hole needs to be big enough to hold the phone securely while it is being charged.",
        "Examining the choices, option A suggests making two holes with one being big enough for the plug-in part and one being able to hold the cellphone while it is hanging.",
        "Option B advices cleaning the empty shampoo bottle first and then making the two holes with the specified sizes.",
        "While both options require making holes for the plug and phone, option B includes cleaning the bottle first, which is a practical step to avoid any damage or mess.",
        "Thus, the correct and more practical answer is B: You get an empty shampoo bottle, you clean it out and make a hole on one side, big enough for the plug in part to fit, then you make another hole big enough to hold your phone."
