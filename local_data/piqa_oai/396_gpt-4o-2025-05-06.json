    "steps": [
        "The initial step in both solutions is to preheat the oven, which is a common practice before baking anything.",
        "Option B suggests preheating the oven to 500 degrees, which is unusually high for baking vegetables and could cause them to burn or dry out.",
        "Option A suggests preheating the oven to 350 degrees, a more typical temperature used for baking vegetables, ensuring even cooking without burning.",
        "The washing, cutting, de-seeding, and oiling of the pumpkin are the same in both options, which is a logical preparation step before baking.",
        "Sprinkling with salt adds flavor, a step included in both options.",
        "Placing the pumpkin cut side down on the baking tray ensures proper heat distribution.",
        "Option B suggests baking for 2 hours at a high temperature, which is excessive and impractical, possibly leading to overcooked or burnt pumpkin.",
        "Option A suggests baking for 35-40 minutes at a moderate temperature, which is reasonable and sufficient to tenderize the pumpkin properly.",
        "Allowing to cool and removing the skin are logical steps after baking.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is \"A: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Wash pumpkin and cut in half. Remove seeds and pith. Rub pumpkin with olive oil inside and out. Sprinkled with salt. Place on a baking tray, cut side down. Bake 35-40 minutes or until tender when pierced. Allow to cool and remove skin with a knife. Pumpkin can be cubed or pureed.\""
