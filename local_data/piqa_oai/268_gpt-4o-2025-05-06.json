    "question": "One wishes to have a multi-functioned belt.\n\nChoices:\nA: One could make a leather belt.\nB: One could make a parachute cord belt.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the main requirement for the belt: multi-functionality.",
        "Next, evaluate the characteristics and potential uses of a leather belt: primarily used for securing pants, can be somewhat fashionable but has limited additional functions.",
        "Now, consider the characteristics and potential uses of a parachute cord belt: versatile and durable, can be used for various survival purposes such as creating a shelter, securing equipment, or even using the cord for emergency situations.",
        "Compare both options keeping the multi-functional aspect in mind.",
        "The parachute cord belt offers more versatility and practical uses beyond just holding pants, which aligns better with the requirement of having a multi-functioned belt.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: One could make a parachute cord belt."
