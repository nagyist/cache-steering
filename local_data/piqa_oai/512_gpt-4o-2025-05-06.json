    "steps": [
        "Toasting a sandwich typically involves cooking the bread so that it becomes crispy and golden brown.",
        "Starting with a heated pan ensures that the bread begins cooking immediately upon contact, leading to a toasted texture.",
        "If you place the bread on a cold pan, it will take longer to heat up, which will result in a less consistent and potentially soggy toasting process.",
