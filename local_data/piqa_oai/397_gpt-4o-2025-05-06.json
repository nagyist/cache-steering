        "To make cheap meat tender, one effective method is to use salt.",
        "Salt helps to break down the proteins and fibers within the meat.",
        "Kosher or sea salt is often recommended because the larger granules are effective at breaking down the meat tissue.",
        "The method involves laying the meat out on a plate and covering each side with approximately 1 teaspoon of the salt.",
        "Using your fingers to gently work the salt granules into the surface of the meat aids in this breakdown process.",
        "Answer choice A mentions using kosher/sea salt for this process, whereas choice B incorrectly mentions garlic granules, which do not have the same tenderizing effect as salt.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: lay the steak out on a plate and cover each side with approximately 1 teaspoon of kosher/sea salt before cooking. Use your fingers to gently work the salt granules into the surface, breaking down the fibers of the meat."
