You will need 4tbsp butter, and a little extra to grease the dish. 1cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup corn syrup, 12 cups condensed milk, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, I need to evaluate the ingredients provided in both choices and compare them with standard recipes for microwave caramels.",
        "I will start by analyzing each ingredient listed in option A:\n- 4tbsp butter\n- 1cup light brown sugar\n- 1/2 cup corn syrup\n- 1/2 cup condensed milk\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla",
        "Next, I will analyze the ingredients listed in option B:\n- 4tbsp butter\n- 1cup light brown sugar\n- 1/2 cup corn syrup\n- 12 cups condensed milk (this seems extremely large compared to typical recipes)\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla",
        "I observe that the amount of condensed milk in option B is highly excessive and inconsistent with typical caramel recipes. Usually, recipes use much less condensed milk.",
        "Given the usual proportions in caramel recipes, option A with 1/2 cup condensed milk is more plausible and accurate.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
