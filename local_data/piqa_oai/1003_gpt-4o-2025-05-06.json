    "steps": [
        "Identify the main actions taken to break the seal on a tight lid of a jar. These main actions are tapping around the lid, using a lever, slapping the jar, and immersing the lid in warm water.",
        "Compare the choices to determine the subtle differences between them.",
        "One key difference is the wording used for slapping the jar, where choice A specifies \"the base of your hand\" and choice B specifies \"the back of your hand.\"",
        "Analyze which term seems more appropriate for effective application of force. Slapping with the base of the hand typically allows for a firmer and more effective force application compared to the back of the hand.",
        "Verify that other methods listed match for both choices and do not influence the selection significantly, as they are identical.",
        "Conclude that choice A offers a more accurate term (\"base of your hand\") for effective force application, leading to the correct answer being A."
