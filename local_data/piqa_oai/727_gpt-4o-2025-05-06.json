    "steps": [
        "During the winter, pipes can freeze if they are exposed to cold temperatures.",
        "Cabinet doors in the kitchen and bathroom often cover pipes that are part of the plumbing system.",
        "If the cabinet doors are closed, cold air can be trapped inside, potentially causing the pipes to freeze.",
        "By opening the cabinet doors, you allow warm air from the room to circulate around the pipes, which helps prevent them from freezing.",
        "Cabinet knobs and drawers do not cover pipes and therefore do not have the same effect.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: open any cabinet doors covering plumbing in the kitchen and bathroom."
