    "steps": [
        "To begin, choose a paint color that you want to use for the wall. This is the first step in painting a wall.",
        "Next, you need to clear the furniture out of the room or away from the walls to ensure that the painting process is not obstructed and to protect the furniture from paint splatter.",
        "After clearing the furniture, it is important to cover the floors with tarp to protect them from paint drips and spills. Taping the sides of the tarp securely ensures that the tarp stays in place and provides maximum protection.",
        "The following step involves painting the walls with even brush strokes, which helps achieve a smooth and uniform finish.",
        "For the final steps, repeating the painting process once or twice ensures an even coating and complete coverage of the wall.",
        "Comparing the choices, answer B specifies taping the sides of the tarp securely, which is important for keeping the protective cover in place. Answer A, mentioning taping the sides loosely, would not provide adequate protection for the floors.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B as it includes taping the sides securely, which is key for effective preparation and protection during the painting process."
