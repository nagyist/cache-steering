    "steps": [
        "Consider the materials and typical build of a food processor; it often contains metal and plastic parts that are designed to be sturdy and able to handle food processing tasks.",
        "Evaluate the properties of a rake; a rake usually has hard, rigid prongs made of metal or strong plastic, making it capable of hitting and breaking hard materials.",
        "Evaluate the properties of a baby wipe; baby wipes are made of soft, moist material designed for gentle cleaning and wouldn't have the structural integrity or hardness to break a food processor.",
        "Considering the comparison, the rigid and hard nature of a rake makes it much more capable of breaking a food processor than the soft, delicate nature of a baby wipe.",
        "Therefore, the logical choice is A: can be broken with a rake."

    "solution": "A"
