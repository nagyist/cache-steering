    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct answer, we need to first assess the characteristics of the materials being cut: peanut brittle and frozen pudding.",
        "Peanut brittle is a hard, dense, and brittle confectionery. It requires significant force or a sharp tool to break or cut due to its hard texture.",
        "Frozen pudding, on the other hand, is softer and less dense compared to peanut brittle, even when frozen. It is more susceptible to being cut by less robust tools.",
        "Floss is typically a thin, yet strong thread. However, it is not designed to cut through extremely hard materials. Instead, it can be used to cut softer items with ease, utilizing its tensile strength.",
        "Therefore, considering the comparative hardness of peanut brittle and frozen pudding, floss is more suited for cutting the less hard material, which in this case is the frozen pudding.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: can cut frozen pudding to make treats."
