    "question": "How can I display flowers in my home without a vase?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use an empty wine bottle.\nB: Use a full wine bottle.",
    "steps": [
        "To display flowers in your home without a vase, you need to find an alternative container that can hold the stems and some water to keep the flowers fresh.",
        "Option A suggests using an empty wine bottle. An empty wine bottle can easily hold flowers and water, serving as an effective makeshift vase.",
        "Option B suggests using a full wine bottle. However, a full wine bottle cannot hold flowers because it is already filled with wine, leaving no space for the stems or water.",
        "Between the two options, an empty wine bottle (Option A) is suitable for displaying flowers because it has empty space to accommodate both flowers and water.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Use an empty wine bottle."
