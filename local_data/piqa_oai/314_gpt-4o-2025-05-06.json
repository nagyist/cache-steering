    "question": "What materials do you need to make flash cotton?\n\nChoices:\nA: Sulfuric acid,Potassium nitrate, baking soda and plastic balls\nB: Sulfuric acid,Potassium nitrate, baking soda and cotton balls",
    "steps": [
        "Flash cotton, also known as nitrocellulose, is made from cellulose fibers found in cotton.",
        "To create flash cotton, cotton balls are treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.",
        "Potassium nitrate and baking soda are commonly used for various reactions in pyrotechnics and chemistry experiments but are not specifically used to create flash cotton.",
        "Plastic balls are irrelevant to the production of flash cotton.",
        "Therefore, among the given options, the materials that are essential to making flash cotton are Sulfuric acid, Potassium nitrate, baking soda, and cotton balls.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is: B: Sulfuric acid, Potassium nitrate, baking soda and cotton balls."
