    "steps": [
        "To determine how to make easy chocolate ganache, we need to understand the basic process required for combining chocolate and cream.",
        "The correct process involves melting the chocolate by using heated cream. This means that the cream must be hot enough to melt the chocolate upon contact.",
        "Option A mentions cooling the cream over the chocolate chips, which would not effectively melt the chocolate.",
        "Option B mentions pouring hot cream over the chocolate, which is the correct method to ensure the chocolate melts smoothly.",
        "Once the hot cream is poured over the chocolate, allowing it to sit for several minutes ensures the chocolate melts properly.",
        "Stirring with a rubber spatula helps combine the melted chocolate and cream to form a smooth ganache.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: To make easy chocolate ganache, put chocolate chips in a large bowl and pour hot cream over top. Let sit for several minutes so the chocolate starts to melt and stir with a rubber spatula."
