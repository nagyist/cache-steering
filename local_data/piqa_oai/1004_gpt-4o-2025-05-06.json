    "question": "how do you move a toy car?\n\nChoices:\nA: start the engine\nB: slide it on the ground",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the nature of the toy car. Most toy cars are simple objects that do not have complex mechanisms like engines.",
        "Next, consider the actions described in the choices. \"Start the engine\" implies a need for a motorized power source, which is not typical for most toy cars.",
        "\"Slide it on the ground\" is a simple, manual action that aligns with how non-motorized toy cars are typically moved.",
        "Therefore, the correct action to move a basic toy car is to slide it on the ground."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
