    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for making deep fried pickles, we should consider the necessary steps involved in the process.",
        "First, we need to slice the pickles because whole pickles are too large to fry effectively.",
        "Next, we need to coat the pickle slices in a substance that will facilitate frying. This is typically done by rolling them in flour.",
        "Finally, we fry the coated pickle slices to achieve the desired deep fried result.",
        "Option A, \"deep fry,\" is incomplete because it does not mention slicing the pickles or rolling them in flour.",
        "Option B, \"slice pickles, roll in flour and fry,\" accurately describes the necessary steps to make deep fried pickles.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: slice pickles, roll in flour and fry."
