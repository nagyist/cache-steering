    "steps": [
        "Consider the context of a 'vase', which is typically an object used to hold flowers or liquids and is hollow inside.",
        "Evaluate the choices: A and B. \"A\" suggests making a boat for donkeys from a vase. The shape and size of a vase generally do not support this idea effectively, as vases are not built to be used as boats.",
        "On the other hand, \"B\" suggests making a feeder for donkeys. A vase, being hollow, can be repurposed to hold food or water, making it suitable as a feeder.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is based on the feasible repurposing of a vase, which aligns with option B."
