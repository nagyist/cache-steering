    "steps": [
        "To determine how to protect a table when painting a wooden project, we need to consider materials that effectively prevent paint from seeping through and potentially damaging the table surface.",
        "Shredded newspaper might be uneven and unreliable for creating a consistent barrier. Smaller pieces of paper might move around or create gaps, which could lead to paint seeping through to the table.",
        "On the other hand, paper towels generally come in large, absorbent sheets that can be laid out uniformly to cover the work surface. They are designed to soak up spills, which makes them suitable for catching any drips or excess paint.",
        "Therefore, lining the work surface with paper towels is a more effective method of protecting the table while painting a wooden project."

    "solution": "B"
