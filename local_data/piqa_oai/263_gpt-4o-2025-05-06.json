    "question": "Prevent liquid layer on peanut butter.\n\nChoices:\nA: Store peanut butter upside down so the oil gets mixed evenly.\nB: Store peanut butter sideways so the oil gets mixed evenly.",
    "steps": [
        "Peanut butter naturally separates, causing the oils to rise to the top.",
        "Storing the jar upside down will allow the oils to naturally mix back into the butter.",
        "This method ensures that the oil does not accumulate on the surface but is evenly distributed throughout.",
        "Storing it sideways would not have the same effect due to the separation dynamics not being influenced in the same balanced manner.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Store peanut butter upside down so the oil gets mixed evenly."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
