    "steps": [
        "To make a portable lantern, you need a container that can hold and diffuse light.",
        "A jar is a suitable container for holding and diffusing light because it is made of transparent material such as glass or clear plastic.",
        "Painting the inside of a jar with non-toxic glow-in-the-dark paint allows the jar to emit light after being charged by a light source.",
        "A stuffed animal, in contrast, is not a suitable container for holding and diffusing light because it is made of opaque materials such as fabric and stuffing.",
        "Moreover, a stuffed animal stuffed with glow-in-the-dark paint would be unable to emit light properly since the paint cannot be charged effectively inside the animal.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer to making a portable lantern is A: Paint the inside of a jar with non-toxic glow-in-the-dark paint."
