    "steps": [
        "Referencing typically involves pointing to something specific to support or illustrate a point.",
        "Using an example from that thing is a more direct method of referencing because it provides concrete evidence or a clear illustration related to the thing being discussed.",
        "Talking about that thing might not necessarily provide a clear or specific connection, making it a less effective form of referencing.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice for how to reference something is to use an example from that thing, as it clearly supports or illustrates the point being made."
