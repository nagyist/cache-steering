        "Identify the question's object: \"bed\".",
        "Examine the characteristics of a bed: generally has a soft, cushioned surface, often springs or foam for comfort.",
        "Consider the activities mentioned in the choices: \"trampoline\" and \"diving board\".",
        "A trampoline is characterized by its bouncy surface meant for jumping, which aligns with the soft, cushioned, and sometimes springy nature of a bed.",
        "A diving board is characterized by a rigid and sturdy surface, intended for diving into water, which does not match the flexible and soft nature of a bed.",
        "Therefore, the easy application of a bed's flexible and springy nature is similar to the function of a trampoline rather than a diving board.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: can be used as a trampoline."
