        "Four Square is a popular playground game involving a rubber ball and four players, each standing in one of the four squares on a court.",
        "To win in Four Square, the players must hit the ball into one of their opponents' squares in such a way that their opponent cannot return it properly.",
        "The player who fails to return the ball correctly is considered \"out\" and has to leave the game or shift to a lower-ranked square.",
        "Given these rules, option A correctly describes the winning condition, as it states that if you hit the ball into an opponent's square and they do not return it, they are out and you win.",
        "Option B mentions catching the ball, which is not part of the standard rules for winning in Four Square, as the game focuses on hitting and returning the ball.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: If you hit the ball into an opponents square and they do not return it, they are out and you win."
