    "steps": [
        "To shut off the water to a toilet, one typically needs to find the water supply valve.",
        "The water supply valve is generally located behind the toilet, near where the water hose connects to the tank.",
        "By bending down and looking behind the toilet, you can locate this valve.",
        "Once located, the knob on the valve should be turned clockwise until it is tight, which will stop the water flow.",
        "Answer choice B suggests looking on top of the toilet, which is incorrect because the water supply valve is not located there.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Bend down and look behind the toilet. Locate the hoses coming in and turn the knob clockwise until it is tight. This will stop the water."
