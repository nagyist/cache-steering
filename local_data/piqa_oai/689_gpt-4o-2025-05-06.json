    "question": "Remove a hickey from neck.\n\nChoices:\nA: Heat a spoon for 20 minutes, then put on hickey spot.\nB: Freeze a spoon for 20 minutes, then put on hickey spot.",
    "steps": [
        "A hickey is essentially a bruise, caused by broken blood vessels under the skin.",
        "Treating a bruise often involves the use of cold compresses to reduce swelling and constrict blood vessels, helping to minimize the appearance of the bruise.",
        "Heating a spoon and applying it to the affected area could potentially exacerbate swelling and inflammation, rather than mitigate it.",
        "Freezing a spoon for 20 minutes allows it to become cold enough to act as a cold compress when applied to the skin.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is to freeze the spoon for 20 minutes and then apply it to the hickey, which aligns with basic principles of treating a bruise."

    "solution": "B"
