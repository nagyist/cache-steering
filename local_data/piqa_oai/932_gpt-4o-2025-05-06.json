    "question": "bin\n\nChoices:\nA: can crush a tablet into powder\nB: can crush a shirt into powder",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider what a bin is and its usage. A bin is typically a container used for storing or disposing of items.",
        "Next, assess the two choices given in the context of what a bin can do. The task is to determine which item a bin can crush into powder.",
        "Choice A states that the bin can crush a tablet into powder. Tablets can be broken down into smaller particles or powder relatively easily by applying pressure or using certain mechanisms a bin might have.",
        "Choice B states that the bin can crush a shirt into powder. Shirts are made of fabric, and crushing fabric into powder is not plausible as fabric would likely tear or shred rather than turn into powder.",
        "Therefore, the more realistic option based on the properties of tablets and shirts, and what a bin can do, is that a bin can crush a tablet into powder.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: can crush a tablet into powder."
