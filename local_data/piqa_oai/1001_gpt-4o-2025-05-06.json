    "steps": [
        "Baking brie cheese typically requires a short cooking time because it is already an almost ready-to-eat cheese, and the goal is to warm it until it starts to soften and ooze without fully melting.",
        "Considering standard baking practices for brie, baking for a duration of 57 minutes will likely cause the brie to overcook and melt entirely, which is not the desired outcome.",
        "Option A involves baking brie for 57 minutes which is excessive for such a soft cheese, as it would likely fully melt or even burn.",
        "Option B suggests baking for 5 to 7 minutes, which is a reasonable and typical duration for warming brie evenly and getting it to the desired oozing but not melting state.",
        "Therefore, Option B is the correct and practical choice for baking brie cheese."
