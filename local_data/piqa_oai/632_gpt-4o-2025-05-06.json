    "steps": [
        "To install hanging containers under kitchen cabinets, we need to secure the jars in a manner that allows for easy access to their contents.",
        "By gluing the top of the mason jars under the kitchen cabinets, we ensure that the jars can be screwed and unscrewed from their lids, which remain glued to the cabinet.",
        "This method of installation makes it possible to twist the jar off for access without compromising the stability of the lid, as the lid remains fixed.",
        "On the other hand, if we glue the bottom of the mason jars under the kitchen cabinets, the jars would not be easily accessible because the jar would need to be removed entirely from whatever is glued, disrupting the convenience of accessing the contents.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer must be A: Glue the top of mason jars under kitchen cabinets, twist jar off for access to contents."
