Place the board(s) across it and slide a saw back and forth against the wood.",
    "steps": [
        "First, let's understand what a saw horse is and its role in cutting wood. A saw horse is a beam with four legs used to support a board or plank for sawing.",
        "Next, consider the action required to cut wood effectively. Using a saw involves the motion of moving it back and forth to create a cut line through the wood.",
        "Compare the given options for cutting wood. Option A mentions pushing the saw down against the wood, which wouldn't result in an effective cut as it doesn't provide the back-and-forth motion necessary.",
        "Option B correctly describes placing the board(s) across the saw horse and involves sliding a saw back and forth against the wood, which is the proper way to cut wood.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Obtain a saw horse and put it somewhere you can work. Place the board(s) across it and slide a saw back and forth against the wood."
