    "question": "What supplies are needed to build a treeless tree house?\n\nChoices:\nA: Six cement blocks (I HIGHLY recommend the kind with epoxied-in metal post brackets. Although they are more pricey, they are much more secure and allow for easily adjusting post and block assemblies. More on that as we go along.)        Six 8-foot pressure treated 4x4 posts        Six 8-foot pressure treated 2x6 boards        One 4- by 8-foot 3/4\" board OSB (same dimensions in exterior grade plywood is another option)        Approximately twenty 8-foot 2x4 boards        Four 10-foot 2x4 boards        Five 26\" x 8' corrugated plastic roof panels        One box (50 pcs.) of roofing screws for corrugated panels (the kind with built-in rubber washers)        5 lb. box of 3\" exterior grade screws        5 lb. box of 1 5/8\" exterior grade screws        Two 50 lb. bags of general purpose sand        Gallon of waterproof sealer        Gallon of deck restoring paint\nB: Six cement blocks (I HIGHLY recommend the kind with epoxied-in metal post brackets.

        "To determine the correct supplies needed to build a treeless tree house, we need to focus on the materials that are appropriate and commonly used for construction work.",
        "Option A provides a list of construction supplies which includes cement blocks, pressure treated wood, OSB boards, screws, sand, waterproof sealer, and deck restoring paint. All of these are relevant and commonly used in building stable structures.",
        "Option B includes a similar list of construction supplies, but notably contains general purpose flour and life restoring paint. Flour is not a construction material and does not contribute to building a tree house. Also, life restoring paint is an ambiguous term and may not refer to standard construction or outdoor paint used for sealing and protecting structures.",
        "Given that general purpose sand is used for construction purposes (such as for stability or leveling), and flour is not suitable for construction, Option A is the correct answer.",
        "Thus, option B includes items that are not relevant to the construction of a tree house, making option A the correct choice."
