    "question": "How to Make Easy Donuts\n\nChoices:\nA: To make easy donuts, you can use a can of refrigerated biscuit dough, like Pillsbury's Grands. Open the biscuit dough out onto a cutting board, and with a small cookie cutter cut the \"O\" out of the center of your donut. (Pro Tip: Reserve these pieces to make Donut Holes!)  Heat vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat until spitting. Begin to add the donuts to the oil slowly, careful not to overcrowd them so they cook evenly. Cook until the bottom is golden brown, and turn gently using two wooden skewers, to brown the other side. Remove from oil to drain on a wire rack. Serve tossed in cinnamon and sugar, or powdered sugar, or you can make a chocolate glaze by melting chocolate chips in the toaster oven with a small amount of butter.\nB: To make easy donuts, you can use a can of refrigerated biscuit dough, like Pillsbury's Grands.
