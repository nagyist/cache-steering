    "steps": [
        "To cook crusts without filling them to ensure they retain their shape, there is a technique called \"blind baking\".",
        "Blind baking often involves using a weight to keep the crust from puffing up or shrinking while it bakes.",
        "Refried beans are not typically used as weights in blind baking. They are intended to be consumed as food.",
        "Dried beans or other types of pie weights are commonly used in blind baking. They hold the crust down, preventing it from puffing up and can be easily removed once the crust is done baking.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Place dried beans into the crust so that you can remove them later."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
