It is commonly used as a tie-down for luggage or equipment. Commercial bungee cords for jumping undergo strict requirements for safety.\nB: Bungee cord is made of one or more strands of an elastic material, usually rubber, bound together by a fabric covering. It is commonly used as a tie-down for luggage or equipment. Commercial bungee cords for jumping undergo no strict requirements for safety.",
    "steps": [
        "To understand how a bungee cord is made, we need to break down the components and processes involved.",
        "A bungee cord consists of one or more strands of an elastic material. This material is usually rubber.",
        "The elastic rubber strands are bound together by a fabric covering, which gives the cord its outer layer.",
        "Bungee cords are commonly used as tie-downs for luggage or equipment because of their elasticity and strength.",
        "When used for jumping, commercial bungee cords must meet strict safety requirements to ensure they can handle the stress and protect the user.",
        "In comparing the choices, option A correctly describes the composition of the bungee cord, its common uses, and the strict safety requirements for commercial jumping cords.",
        "Option B is incorrect because it states that commercial bungee cords for jumping undergo no strict safety requirements, which is not true as safety is a critical factor in their design and manufacture.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: A."
