    "question": "How do you use clothes to look shorter?\n\nChoices:\nA: Wear a top that is the same color as your bottom.\nB: Wear a top that is different in color than your bottom.",
    "steps": [
        "To look shorter, you need to break up the visual line of your body.",
        "Wearing a top that is different in color than your bottom creates a clear distinction between the upper and lower parts of your body.",
        "This contrast will visually segment your body, effectively appearing to shorten your height.",
        "On the contrary, wearing a top that is the same color as your bottom would create a continuous visual line from top to bottom, elongating your appearance rather than shortening it.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is to wear a top that is different in color than your bottom to look shorter."

    "solution": "B"
