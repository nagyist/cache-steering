    "steps": [
        "First, consider the typical method of juicing fruit. Juicing commonly involves extracting the juice directly from the fruit itself.",
        "Blending a fruit in the blender generally turns it into a puree or smoothie rather than extracting its juice.",
        "Therefore, blending the fruit in the blender (Choice A) does not align with the direct method of juicing fruit.",
        "The correct method for juicing fruit is to squeeze all the juice out of them, which aligns with Choice B."
