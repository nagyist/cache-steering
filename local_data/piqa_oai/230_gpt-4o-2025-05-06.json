    "question": "To turn off the water supply to your house\n\nChoices:\nA: Go out to the meter at the street. Turn the valve as far as it will go either way.\nB: Go out to the meter at the street. Turn the valve as far as it will go clockwise.",
    "steps": [
        "Water supply valves typically operate similarly to other types of valves in which turning clockwise generally closes the valve.",
        "Option A does not specify a clear direction to turn the valve, which could lead to confusion and potentially fail to turn off the water supply.",
        "Option B specifies turning the valve clockwise, which is the standard direction for closing valves.",
        "Clockwise turning closes the valve by pushing the gate or disc inside it, thereby restricting the flow of water.",
        "Following directions clearly is crucial, especially in home maintenance tasks such as turning off the water supply. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Go out to the meter at the street. Turn the valve as far as it will go clockwise."

    "solution": "B"
