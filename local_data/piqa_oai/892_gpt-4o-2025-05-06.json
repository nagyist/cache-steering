    "steps": [
        "First, consider the goal of the question, which is to avoid ruining a nice Halloween costume.",
        "Next, evaluate the potential of the given options to achieve that goal.",
        "Option A suggests wearing a different low-key, DIY costume to school instead of the real one. This choice minimizes the risk because the nice costume is not worn to school and thus won't be subjected to potential damage.",
        "Option B suggests not participating in any Halloween festivities at school. While this avoids any risk of ruining the costume, it also eliminates participation in activities, which may be undesirable or impractical for some.",
        "Comparing the two options, Option A achieves the goal of avoiding damage to a nice costume while still allowing participation in Halloween festivities with a different costume.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: where a different low key, DIY costume to school instead of your real one."
