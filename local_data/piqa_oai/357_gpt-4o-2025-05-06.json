    "question": "To prevent the fats from escaping a homemade burger patty,\n\nChoices:\nA: do not over work the patty, which causes the fat to stick to your hands.\nB: coat the outside of the patty with salt and flour.",
    "steps": [
        "The fats in a homemade burger patty contribute to its juicy texture and flavor.",
        "When preparing a burger patty, overworking the mixture can cause the fat to become too integrated with the other ingredients, causing it to stick to your hands and reduce its presence in the final cooked patty.",
        "Option A suggests not overworking the patty to avoid the fats from sticking to your hands, thus ensuring that the fats remain within the patty itself, contributing to the desired juiciness and flavor.",
        "Coating the outside of the patty with salt and flour (Option B) does not address the issue of fats escaping during the preparation process.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: do not over work the patty, which causes the fat to stick to your hands."
