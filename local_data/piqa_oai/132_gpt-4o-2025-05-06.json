    "question": "How can I apply eyeshadow without a brush?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a cotton swab to apply shadow.\nB: Use a toothpick to apply shadow.",
    "steps": [
        "Eyeshadow is typically applied using soft materials to avoid damaging the delicate skin around the eyes.",
        "A cotton swab has a soft and absorbent texture that can hold onto the shadow and apply it smoothly onto the eyelid.",
        "A toothpick is hard, non-absorbent, and potentially dangerous to use around the sensitive eye area. It is not suitable for applying makeup.",
        "Therefore, comparing both options, using a cotton swab is a safer and more effective method for applying eyeshadow without a brush.",
        "Consequently, the correct answer is A: Use a cotton swab to apply shadow."
