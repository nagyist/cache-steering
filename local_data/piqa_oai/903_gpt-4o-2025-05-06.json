    "question": "How to prepare fabric from a pattern to make clothing.\n\nChoices:\nA: Place pattern onto fabric and cut inside the lines by one quarter inch.\nB: Trace clothing pattern pieces onto another sheet of paper, account for seam allowances if necessary, attach to fabric and cut out.",
    "steps": [
        "First, examine the two choices given in the question.",
        "Option A suggests placing the pattern onto the fabric and cutting inside the lines by one quarter inch. This method does not provide clear instructions on how to handle the seam allowances, which are crucial for sewing the pieces together.",
        "Option B involves tracing the clothing pattern pieces onto another sheet of paper, accounting for seam allowances, attaching the traced pieces to the fabric, and cutting them out.",
        "Next, consider the importance of seam allowances in sewing. Seam allowances are extra fabric provided along the edges of fabric pieces that allow them to be sewn together. Accounting for seam allowances ensures that the final garment has accurate dimensions when sewn together.",
        "Option B specifically mentions accounting for seam allowances, which is a necessary step in preparing fabric for making clothing.",
        "Therefore, Option B provides a more comprehensive and accurate method for preparing fabric from a pattern to make clothing because it includes the step of accounting for seam allowances.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Trace clothing pattern pieces onto another sheet of paper, account for seam allowances if necessary, attach to fabric and cut out."
