    "question": "How can you keep doors from hitting the garage walls?\n\nChoices:\nA: Place a macaroni noodle at the height the door normally hits the wall, to cushion it.\nB: Place a pool noodle at the height the door normally hits the wall, to cushion it.",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the problem: preventing doors from hitting and possibly damaging the garage walls.",
        "Analyze the provided choices:\nChoice A suggests using a macaroni noodle to cushion the impact.\nChoice B suggests using a pool noodle to cushion the impact.",
        "Consider the materials: macaroni noodles are small and brittle, providing little to no cushioning or protection for either the door or the wall.",
        "On the other hand, pool noodles are large, soft, and made of foam, which are designed to provide cushioning and can absorb impacts effectively.",
        "Thus, out of the two options, a pool noodle is more suitable for cushioning the door's impact against the wall due to its size, material, and design.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: Place a pool noodle at the height the door normally hits the wall, to cushion it."

    "solution": "B"
