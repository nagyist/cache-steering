    "question": "How do you sack the quarterback in football?\n\nChoices:\nA: Prevent the opposing team from getting a first down on third down, causing an punting situation.\nB: Tackle the quarterback before they release the ball and are behind the line of scrimmage.",
    "steps": [
        "To identify how to sack the quarterback, we first need to understand what the term \"sack\" means in American football.",
        "A sack is a statistic in American football that occurs when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the quarterback can throw a forward pass.",
        "By definition, option B aligns with the description of a sack. B states \"Tackle the quarterback before they release the ball and are behind the line of scrimmage.\"",
        "Option A describes a different football scenario where the opposing team is stopped short of a first down on third down, forcing them to punt. This is not the definition of a sack.",
        "Therefore, based on the definition and context provided, the correct answer is indeed B: \"Tackle the quarterback before they release the ball and are behind the line of scrimmage.\""
    ],
    "solution": "B"
