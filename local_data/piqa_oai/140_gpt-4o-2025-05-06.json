        "To determine how to make an Oreo pie crust, we need to consider the common method of creating pie crusts using cookie crumbs.",
        "Both answer choices mention mixing Oreos with butter until the mixture is moldable, which is a key step in making a cookie crumb crust.",
        "The differentiation between the two choices lies in whether the mixture should cover just the bottom of the pan or both the bottom and the sides of the pan.",
        "For a typical pie crust, it's standard to have the crust on both the bottom and the sides of the pie pan to hold the filling properly. This ensures structural integrity when the pie is sliced and served.",
