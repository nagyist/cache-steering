    "question": "How can I keep batter from splattering when mixing?\n\nChoices:\nA: Place a paper plate on the bottom of the beaters while you are holding over the bowl.\nB: Place a paper plate on the top of the beaters while you are holding over the bowl.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the mechanics of how a mixer works. When the beaters spin, they tend to fling the batter outward from the bowl.",
        "The goal is to prevent the batter from escaping the bowl and creating a mess.",
        "If you place a paper plate on the bottom of the beaters, it won't stop the batter from splattering, as the beaters are above and the batter is likely to be flung outward.",
        "Placing a paper plate on the top of the beaters creates a shield that prevents the batter from flying out of the bowl and splattering your surroundings.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice to keep batter from splattering when mixing is B: Place a paper plate on the top of the beaters while you are holding over the bowl."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
