    "question": "How do I clean the shoelaces from my shoes once they are removed from my shoe?\n\nChoices:\nA: Quickly stir the shoelaces around in a solution of 1:1 laundry detergent to water; don't worry if they are fully submerged.\nB: Fully submerge the shoelaces in a solution of 1:1 laundry detergent to water and stir until the laces are fully saturated.",
    "steps": [
        "To clean shoelaces effectively, it is important to ensure that the entire surface of the shoelace is exposed to the cleaning solution.",
        "Submerging the shoelaces completely in a solution allows the detergent to penetrate all layers of the fabric.",
        "Stirring the shoelaces while they are fully submerged helps to evenly distribute the detergent throughout the laces and ensures every part is cleaned.",
        "The alternate option, which involves not fully submerging the laces, could leave parts of the shoelaces uncleaned because the solution would not reach all areas.",
        "Therefore, the correct and more effective method is to fully submerge the shoelaces in a solution of 1:1 laundry detergent to water and stir them until fully saturated, as stated in option B."
