    "question": "How do you melt beeswax?\n\nChoices:\nA: Measure out the amount of beeswax you want to melt. Boil one cup of water inside of a pot. Reduce the heat on the stove to low and place a smaller glass bowl into the water in the pot. Put the beeswax into the glass bowl. Stir the beeswax slightly as it melts to allow the heat to melt it all the way through.\nB: Measure out the amount of beeswax you want to melt. Boil one cup of water inside of a pot. Reduce the heat on the stove to low and fill a smaller glass bowl with the water in the pot. Put the beeswax into the glass bowl. Stir the beeswax slightly as it melts to allow the heat to melt it all the way through.",
    "steps": [
        "To understand how to melt beeswax, we need to consider the steps effectively used in the process.",
        "First, we measure out the desired amount of beeswax. This is common to both options A and B.",
        "Next, boiling one cup of water inside of a pot is also a step in both options A and B.",
        "Reducing the heat on the stove to low follows the boiling process, which is indicated in both choices.",
        "The significant difference comes in the step involving the glass bowl. In option A, the instruction is to place the glass bowl into the water in the pot. This implies using the pot with water to create a double boiler effect.",
        "In option B, however, the instruction is to fill the smaller glass bowl with the water in the pot. This suggests transferring the water into the bowl itself, which is not practical for melting beeswax because beeswax should melt with indirect heat rather than being directly mixed with water.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice would be option A:\nMeasure out the amount of beeswax you want to melt.\nBoil one cup of water inside of a pot.\nReduce the heat on the stove to low and place a smaller glass bowl into the water in the pot.\nPut the beeswax into the glass bowl.\nStir the beeswax slightly as it melts to allow the heat to melt it all the way through."
