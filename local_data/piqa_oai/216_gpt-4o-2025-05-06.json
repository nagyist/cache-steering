    "steps": [
        "First, consider the properties of cardboard. It is a lightweight and typically thin material.",
        "Next, think about common methods to fix or repair something made of cardboard. Since cardboard is relatively fragile and easy to tear, a simple solution like tape is often effective.",
        "Now, evaluate the choices given: duct tape and vise. Duct tape is sticky and can adhere to surfaces like cardboard, often used for quick fixes and repairs.",
        "A vise, on the other hand, is a tool used to hold objects firmly in place, typically for purposes like cutting, shaping, or other mechanical work. It is not suitable for repairing cardboard, which requires something to mend the tears or hold torn pieces together.",
        "Therefore, considering the functions of both duct tape and vise, the correct choice for fixing cardboard is duct tape.",
        "The correct answer is A: can be fixed with duct tape."
