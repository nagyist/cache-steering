    "steps": [
        "Consider the physical properties of a sword and the objects it is supposed to penetrate.",
        "A sword is typically long, thin, and made of metal with a sharp edge designed for cutting or thrusting.",
        "Analyzing the properties of an apple, it is soft, low-density, and easy to cut through.",
        "Penetrating an apple would require minimal force, making it a feasible task for a sword.",
        "On the other hand, a brick wall is solid, high-density, and significantly harder than an apple.",
        "Penetrating a brick wall would require immense force and durability, beyond what a sword is designed to achieve.",
        "Therefore, given the choices, the correct answer is A: can penetrate an apple."
