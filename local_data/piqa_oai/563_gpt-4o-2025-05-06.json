    "question": "Reduce chances of blisters from high heels.\n\nChoices:\nA: Line inside of high heels with baby powder.\nB: Line inside of high heels with baby oil.",
    "steps": [
        "High heels often cause blisters due to friction between the skin and the shoe.",
        "Baby powder can reduce friction by absorbing moisture and creating a smooth interface between the skin and the shoe, thereby potentially reducing the chances of blisters.",
        "Baby oil, on the other hand, is slippery and could increase the risk of slipping within the shoe, which might not effectively reduce friction and could even make the problem worse.",
        "Therefore, baby powder is a more suitable option to reduce chances of blisters from high heels."
