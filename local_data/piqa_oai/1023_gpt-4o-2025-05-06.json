        "Think about how a monkey typically peels a banana. Unlike most humans who peel from the stem end, monkeys often peel from the opposite end, holding the stem downwards.",
        "Monkeys pinch or push at the tip of the banana to tear the skin, making it easier to peel without squashing the banana.",
        "Monkeys then peel downwards towards the stem, which helps in evenly removing the peel and avoids any breakage or mess.",
        "Considering the description of 'monkey magic,' it aligns with the natural method used by monkeys.",
        "Option A describes this exact process: holding the banana with the stem downwards, pinching or pushing at the tip, and peeling downwards towards the stem.",
        "Option B, on the other hand, suggests pinching or pushing at the side and all the way through the banana, which is not a known or natural method used by monkeys.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A."
