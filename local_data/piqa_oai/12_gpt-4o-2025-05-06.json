    "question": "how do you open a capri-sun\n\nChoices:\nA: open the straw attached to the juice, and then stick it in the small hole at the front of the pouch.\nB: cut the top off with scissors",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the packaging of Capri-Sun. It typically comes in a soft pouch with a straw attached.",
        "Check the pouch to find the area designed for inserting the straw, which is usually a small, designated spot near the top of the pouch.",
        "The straw is usually directly attached to the pouch for easy access. The correct method involves using this provided straw.",
        "Now, open the attached straw, which is often wrapped in plastic that can be peeled off.",
        "Take the straw and locate the small hole at the front of the pouch which is intended for straw insertion.",
        "Insert the straw into the small hole to access the juice inside the pouch.",
        "Cutting the top with scissors would not utilize the designed mechanism and might lead to spilling the liquid.",
        "Therefore, the correct method to open a Capri-Sun is to open the attached straw and stick it into the small hole at the front of the pouch.",
        "So, the correct answer is A: open the straw attached to the juice, and then stick it in the small hole at the front of the pouch."
