    "question": "To remove the protective cover from a wire, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a wire stripper\nB: Use a wire cutter",
    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct tool for removing the protective cover from a wire, consider the specific function of each tool mentioned in the choices.",

        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Use a wire stripper."
