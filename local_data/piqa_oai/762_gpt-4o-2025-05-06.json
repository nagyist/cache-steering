    "steps": [
        "First, identify the components of the American flag pattern, which includes red and white stripes.",
        "To create red stripes, fully staining some boards is necessary.",
        "To create white stripes, partially staining the remaining boards will give the effect of white stripes, since the wood's natural color can represent white.",
        "Choice A directly explains how to achieve both red and white stripes by using full and partial staining techniques on different boards.",
        "Choice B only talks about preparation (sanding) but does not mention the specific staining technique required to create the stripes.",
        "Therefore, Choice A correctly describes how to stain boards to resemble the striped American flag pattern."
