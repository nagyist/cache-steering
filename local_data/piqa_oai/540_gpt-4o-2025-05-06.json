    "question": "How do you cut wire down into smaller pieces?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use wire snips, put the wire between the blades, then squeeze shut.\nB: Use wire snips, put the wire between the handles, then squeeze shut.",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the function of wire snips. Wire snips are designed with sharp blades specifically made to cut through wires.",
        "Next, analyze the design of wire snips. They have handles for holding and applying pressure, and blades for cutting.",
        "Consider the options given. Option A instructs to put the wire between the blades and then squeeze shut, which is a logical use of the sharp cutting area of the snips.",
        "Option B, on the other hand, suggests putting the wire between the handles, which is incorrect because the handles are not designed to cut but to be held.",
        "Finally, conclude that option A is correct as it uses the wire snips in the proper manner to cut the wire using the blades."
