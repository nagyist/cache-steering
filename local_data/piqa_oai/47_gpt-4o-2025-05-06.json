        "When considering how to remove vinyl wall art, it is important to choose a method that will effectively lift the vinyl without causing damage to the wall or underlying paint.",
        "A toothpick is a very small and sharp tool, which might not be effective in scraping under the edges of the vinyl. It could also potentially damage the paint or the wall surface due to its sharpness and small surface area.",
        "A library card, however, provides a flat, broad, and sturdy edge that can effectively slide under the edges of the vinyl wall art. This broad edge allows for better control and leverage while minimizing the risk of damaging the wall or the paint underneath.",
        "Given that the library card offers a better balance of effectiveness and safety, it is the preferred tool for removing vinyl wall art.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B: Use the edge of a library card scrape under the edges without damaging the paint underneath."
