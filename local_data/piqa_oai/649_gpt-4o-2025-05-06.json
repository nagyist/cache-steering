    "steps": [
        "Sandpaper is an abrasive material. It has a rough surface that is used to grind and smooth other surfaces.",
        "Paint is a substance that often needs to be removed from surfaces for refinishing or painting anew. Sandpaper works effectively for this purpose due to its abrasive nature.",
        "Soap, on the other hand, generally dissolves in water and does not require an abrasive material to be removed.",
        "Therefore, sandpaper is suitable for scrubbing paint off but not soap off.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B."
