    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand the purpose of weighing down a shower pan after applying a thin set. The main goal is to ensure the pan adheres properly and stays in place while the thin set cures.",
        "Next, we consider the types of items that would be appropriate for weighing down the shower pan. These items need to be heavy enough to provide the necessary pressure.",
        "Boxes of tiles are heavy and widely used in tiling projects, so they would be readily available and effective for this purpose.",
        "Bags of thin set are also heavy and commonly found on site during shower pan installations, making them a practical choice as well.",
        "On the other hand, boxes of towels are not typically heavy enough to provide the needed weight for this task.",
        "Therefore, the most suitable choice involves using heavy items that are commonly found on a job site, such as boxes of tiles or bags of thin set.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: You can place a heavy item such as boxes of tiles or bags of thin set onto the shower pan to weigh it down."
