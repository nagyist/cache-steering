    "question": "How can I identify keys quickly on a key ring?\n\nChoices:\nA: Paint each key head a different color with nail polish.\nB: Paint each key head with a coat of clear polish.",
    "steps": [
        "Identify the problem: The key ring has multiple keys, and recognizing the correct one quickly is the challenge.",
        "Examine the first option: Painting each key head a different color with nail polish can create distinct visual cues for each key. This would make it easy to identify and grab the correct key quickly.",
        "Examine the second option: Painting each key head with a clear coat of polish would not create any visual differentiation between the keys, so it would not help in identifying them quickly.",
        "Compare the effectiveness of both options: Option A creates a clear, visual distinction between keys, while Option B does not provide any visible differentiation.",
        "Determine the best solution: To quickly identify keys on a key ring, visible distinctions are crucial. Option A provides this solution effectively.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Paint each key head a different color with nail polish."
