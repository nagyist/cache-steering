    "steps": [
        "Identify the goal: To cross the crosswalk safely.",
        "Determine the meaning of signals: At crosswalks, red typically means stop, and white typically indicates it is safe to walk.",
        "Interpret button function: Pressing the button signals the system to eventually change the traffic lights to allow pedestrians to cross.",
        "Match signal with action: Since white signal means walk, the correct behavior is to walk when the signal turns white.",
        "Eliminate incorrect answer: Red signal means stop, so waiting for it to turn red is incorrect for walking.",
        "Select correct answer: Press the button, then wait until it turns white then walk."
