    "question": "how to mix cement\n\nChoices:\nA: Make a crater in the pile of cement. Add a small amount of water. Adjust the mixture as necessary. Pour the mixed cement immediately into your project's area\nB: Make a crater in the pile of sand. Add a small amount of glycerine  Adjust the mixture as necessary. Pour the mixed cement immediately into your project's area",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the fundamental components of cement. Cement is commonly mixed with water to activate the chemical processes that cause it to harden.",
        "Second, note that sand is often used as an aggregate in concrete but not typically in the initial mixing of cement alone; glycerine is not a standard component in cement mixing.",
        "The correct process involves creating a crater or depression in the cement pile, adding water, and adjusting until the desired consistency is achieved, followed by immediate use.",
        "Thus, option A correctly describes making a crater in the pile of cement, adding a small amount of water, adjusting the mixture, and pouring it into the project area."
