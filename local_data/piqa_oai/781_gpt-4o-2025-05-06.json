    "steps": [
        "When looking to save money on products at the store, one effective strategy is to choose the generic store brand.",
        "Generic store brands typically cost less than name brand products because they do not spend as much money on marketing and packaging.",
        "Often, generic store brand products have similar quality to name brand products since they can sometimes be produced by the same manufacturers.",
        "Using only name brand products, even those that are cheaper, usually doesn't maximize savings since name brands generally have higher prices than generic store brands.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice to save money on products is to look for a generic store brand version of products."
