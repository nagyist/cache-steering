    "question": "How much paint do you need to paint a room?\n\nChoices:\nA: One gallon can of paint will cover up to 400 square feet, which is enough to cover a small room like a bathroom. Two gallon cans of paint cover up to 800 square feet, which is enough to cover an average size room. This is the most common amount needed especially when considering second coat coverage.\nB: One gallon can of paint will cover up to 600 square feet, which is enough to cover a small room like a bathroom. Two gallon cans of paint cover up to 800 square feet, which is enough to cover an average size room. This is the most common amount needed especially when considering second coat coverage.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to verify the coverage area provided by one gallon of paint.",
        "It is usually accepted that one gallon of paint covers approximately 400 square feet.",
        "Next, we evaluate the coverage for two gallons of paint, which should be the twice the coverage of a single gallon.",
        "Two gallons would cover up to 800 square feet, double that of one gallon (400 sq ft x 2 = 800 sq ft).",
        "Now, let's check the common uses for the coverage. A small room like a bathroom is typically around 400 square feet or less.",
        "An average-sized room tends to be around 800 square feet or less. For two coats, this amount of paint is most common.",
        "The answer choice A aligns with these details: one gallon covers 400 square feet, and two gallons cover 800 square feet.",
        "Answer choice B states that one gallon covers 600 square feet, which is not typically accurate according to standard coverage rates.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A."
