    "steps": [
        "First, review the question and options carefully to understand the context. The question is about cleaning up broken glass.",
        "Notice that both options involve using a flashlight to detect leftover pieces of glass after initial cleanup.",
        "Option A suggests that leftover pieces of glass will make a shadow, making them visible on the floor.",
        "Option B incorrectly suggests that leftover pieces of glass will make a sound, which is not a practical method for detecting glass pieces visually.",
        "Based on practical experience, light cast by a flashlight will create shadows of small glass pieces, making them easier to detect and remove.",
        "Option A is logically sound and practical for visually detecting tiny shards of glass.",
        "Therefore, the correct option is A: Lay a flashlight on the floor. Any left over pieces will make a shadow so you can pick them up before you feet do."
