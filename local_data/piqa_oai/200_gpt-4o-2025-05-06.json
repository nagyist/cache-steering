    "question": "To clean off rust from a metal table that was resistant to vinegar.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a soft bristle brush.\nB: Use a stiff metal bristle brush.",
    "steps": [
        "Rust is a common problem for metal surfaces, and certain methods are more effective than others for its removal.",
        "When vinegar proves ineffective, a more abrasive method is often necessary to physically remove the rust.",
        "A soft bristle brush is typically ineffective in removing rust due to its gentle nature.",
        "A stiff metal bristle brush, on the other hand, is designed to effectively scrape off rust from metal surfaces because of its rigid and abrasive properties.",
        "Therefore, using a stiff metal bristle brush is a more appropriate choice for cleaning off rust from a metal table when vinegar is not effective.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Use a stiff metal bristle brush."
