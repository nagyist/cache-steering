    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand the context of the word \"roller.\"",
        "The term \"roller\" typically refers to a cylindrical tool used for shaping, flattening, or pressing materials in various contexts.",
        "Next, we should evaluate the two given choices in relation to the term \"roller\":\n- Choice A mentions \"tofu,\" a food item that is often cut, pressed, or shaped.\n- Choice B mentions \"the sun,\" an astronomical body where pressing or shaping would not be relevant or possible.",
        "Considering practical applications, pushing a roller into the center of tofu is a plausible culinary action, whereas pushing a roller into the center of the sun is not feasible.",
        "Therefore, the answer based on practicality and common use of a roller aligns with Choice A: pushed into the center of tofu."
