Check the Enable checkbox and adjust the slider.\nB: Click Extended Settings at the bottom, then click the Advanced tab. Check the Enable checkbox and adjust the slider.",
    "steps": [
        "To answer this question correctly, we need to understand the features of VLC Media Player and how one would typically change the pitch of audio within the software.",
        "VLC Media Player has a variety of advanced audio settings. To access these settings, the user usually needs to enter an advanced settings menu.",
        "Option A mentions \"Click the play button at the bottom\" which is typically used for directly playing or pausing media, and does not sound like an intuitive way to access advanced audio settings.",
        "Option B, on the other hand, mentions \"Click Extended Settings at the bottom\" which makes more sense as a plausible method to access advanced options.",
        "This method allows the user to access the Advanced tab, where more audio manipulation options, like changing the pitch, would logically be found.",
        "Considering typical user interface design and user experience patterns in media players, Option B is the more intuitive and correct answer.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Click Extended Settings at the bottom, then click the Advanced tab. Check the Enable checkbox and adjust the slider."
