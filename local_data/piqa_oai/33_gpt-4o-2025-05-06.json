    "question": "To create a basic wooden serving tray,\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a strong, preferably finished wooden base. Screw in wooden handles from the bottom of the base into the handles for easier holding\nB: Use a strong, preferably finished wooden base. Screw in wooden frames from the bottom of the base into the handles for easier holding",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the key components needed to make a wooden serving tray: a wooden base and handles.",
        "Consider the purpose of handles on a serving tray, which is to make the tray easier to hold and carry.",
        "Evaluate the options provided in the choices. Choice A involves screwing in wooden handles, and Choice B involves screwing in wooden frames.",
        "Understand that the term \"handles\" more accurately describes the component needed for holding than \"frames,\" which typically refers to a structural support.",
        "Given that handles are specifically designed for grasping and carrying, and frames are not typically used for this purpose, Choice A is the more appropriate and logical answer.",
        "Therefore, to create a basic wooden serving tray, you should use Choice A: a strong, preferably finished wooden base with wooden handles screwed in from the bottom of the base into the handles for easier holding."
