    "question": "Sharpen scissor blades.\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut through a piece of steel wool.\nB: Cut through a piece of cotton wool.",
    "steps": [
        "Scissor blades become dull due to wear and tear over time and need to be sharpened to restore their cutting efficiency.",
        "Sharpening involves grinding or cutting through a material that helps remove tiny fragments of metal from the blades, effectively creating a new, sharper edge.",
        "Steel wool is a rough and abrasive material that can help to physically grind and sharpen the edges of the scissor blades. When the scissors cut through the steel wool, the friction and abrasive qualities of the steel wool sharpen the blades.",
        "Cotton wool, on the other hand, is a very soft material with no abrasive properties. Cutting through cotton wool would not sharpen the blades; it would simply get cut without any effect on the sharpness of the scissors.",
        "Therefore, cutting through a piece of steel wool is the correct method for sharpening scissor blades among the given choices.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Cut through a piece of steel wool."
