    "question": "To prevent onions from making you cry when they are cut,\n\nChoices:\nA: freeze the onions for twenty minutes before cutting.\nB: use a serrated knife instead of a smooth edged one.",
    "steps": [
        "Cutting onions releases a gas called syn-Propanethial-S-oxide, which causes a stinging sensation in the eyes, leading to tears.",
        "Freezing the onions helps to minimize the release of this gas by slowing down the enzymatic reaction that produces it.",
        "This cooling effect can make the gas less volatile and therefore less likely to reach your eyes.",
        "Using a serrated knife does not significantly impact the release of syn-Propanethial-S-oxide compared to a smooth-edged knife.",
        "Therefore, freezing the onions for twenty minutes before cutting is the more effective method to prevent onions from making you cry."

    "solution": "A"
