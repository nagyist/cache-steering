    "question": "To add sugar and edible glitter to candy apples.\n\nChoices:\nA: As carefully as you can, swirl each apple one by one in the sugar mixture and then transfer quickly to the bowl of edible glitter and coat as well as you can. Set aside on parchment and let cool.\nB: As firm as you can, swirl each apple one by one in the sugar mixture and then transfer quickly to the bowl of edible glitter and coat as well as you can. Set aside on parchment and let cool.",
    "steps": [
        "First, evaluate the nature of the task of adding sugar and edible glitter to candy apples. This task involves handling potentially hot materials (such as molten sugar). It also involves achieving an even coating of sugar and glitter on the apples.",
        "Next, consider the need for precision and delicacy in this task. Swirling the apple too firmly might damage the apple or cause uneven coating.",
        "Assess the meaning of the word \"carefully\". Careful implies doing something with caution, precision, and attention to detail. This aligns with the need to handle potentially hot and sticky materials properly and achieve an even coating.",
        "Now, consider the word \"firmly\". Firmly implies using strength or applying force. This is not ideal for a task that requires delicacy and precision.",
        "Compare the two options:\n- Option A suggests swirling each apple as carefully as you can.\n- Option B suggests swirling each apple as firm as you can.\n\nGiven the task's requirement for delicacy and precision, \"carefully\" is the more appropriate choice.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is A, as it recommends a careful approach, which is more suitable for the task at hand.",
        "The correct answer is thus: A: As carefully as you can, swirl each apple one by one in the sugar mixture and then transfer quickly to the bowl of edible glitter and coat as well as you can. Set aside on parchment and let cool."
