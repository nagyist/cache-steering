    "question": "Heat\n\nChoices:\nA: alters sand \nB: alters fire ",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the given choices: \"A: alters sand\" and \"B: alters fire\".",
        "Evaluate how heat interacts with sand. When exposed to sufficient heat, sand can melt and transform into glass.",
        "Next, evaluate how heat interacts with fire. Fire itself is a manifestation of heat, so saying that heat alters fire is not logically sound.",
        "Comparing both evaluations, the alteration of sand by heat is a more concrete and accurate statement.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is: \"A: alters sand\"."
    ],
    "solution": "A"
