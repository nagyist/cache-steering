    "question": "To make caramel, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Place water and salt on the stove and cook it until the salt starts to burn\nB: Place water and sugar on the stove and cook it until the sugar starts to burn",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand what caramel is. Caramel is a confectionery product made by heating sugar until it melts and turns into a golden-brown color.",
        "Caramelization is the process of cooking sugar, which involves heating sugar to high temperatures, causing it to undergo a series of chemical reactions and transform into caramel.",
        "Option A suggests placing water and salt on the stove. However, salt does not caramelize and burning salt would result in an undesirable taste. Therefore, this option does not describe the correct process for making caramel.",
        "Option B suggests placing water and sugar on the stove and cooking it until the sugar starts to burn. While we don\u2019t want to overcook the sugar to the point of burning, this option correctly identifies sugar as the necessary ingredient to caramelize and create caramel.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Place water and sugar on the stove and cook it until the sugar starts to burn."
