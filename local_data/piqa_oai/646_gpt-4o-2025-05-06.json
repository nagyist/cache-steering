        "To preheat an oven, the goal is to set it to a specific temperature suitable for cooking the intended food.",
        "The oven dashboard typically has a knob with various temperature settings indicated around it.",
        "Turning the knob to a specific temperature ensures the oven will heat up to that precise level.",
        "Option A mentions turning the knob until the line is next to the desired temperature, which aligns with the goal of preheating the oven to a specific temperature.",
        "Option B mentions turning the knob until the line is next to the word \"Broil,\" which is a different setting used for cooking methods involving high heat from above rather than preheating.",
