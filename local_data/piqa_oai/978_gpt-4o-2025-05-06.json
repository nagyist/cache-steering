    "question": "How can I keep eggs from sticking to a cup while microwaving?\n\nChoices:\nA: Coat the cup with melted butter after cooking.\nB: Coat the cup with melted butter before cooking.",
    "steps": [
        "To prevent eggs from sticking to a cup while microwaving, you need a non-stick barrier between the eggs and the surface of the cup.",
        "Melted butter acts as a non-stick barrier that helps to prevent food from adhering to surfaces due to its lubricating properties.",
        "Applying the melted butter before cooking creates a layer that separates the eggs from the cup, reducing the chance of sticking during the microwaving process.",
        "Applying the melted butter after cooking would not be effective, as the eggs would have already adhered to the cup during the cooking process.",
        "Therefore, the correct action is to coat the cup with melted butter before cooking to ensure that the eggs do not stick.",
        "Given the choices, B: Coat the cup with melted butter before cooking is the correct answer."
