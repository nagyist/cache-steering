    "question": "D.I.Y aged paper with used tea bags.\n\nChoices:\nA: Make a strong tea with 6-7 used tea bags. Take a soft towel dip it into the tea and dab the tea onto the paper. Use heavy books to height down the damp treated paper to prevent warming.\nB: Make a strong tea with 6-7 used tea bags. Take a soft towel dip it into the tea and dab the tea onto the paper. Use heavy books to weigh down the damp treated paper to prevent warping.",
    "steps": [
        "First, let's understand the task: DIY aged paper using used tea bags.",
        "The task is to use tea bags to create an aged look on paper by treating it with tea.",
        "Both choices describe the process of making strong tea with 6-7 used tea bags, using a soft towel to dab the tea onto the paper, and placing heavy books on the paper.",
        "However, the difference lies in the final instruction: Choice A says \"to height down the damp treated paper to prevent warming,\" while Choice B says \"to weigh down the damp treated paper to prevent warping.\"",
        "Considering the context, \"prevent warping\" makes more sense as heavy books are used to keep the paper flat and smooth while drying to avoid any warping.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is B: Make a strong tea with 6-7 used tea bags. Take a soft towel dip it into the tea and dab the tea onto the paper. Use heavy books to weigh down the damp treated paper to prevent warping."
