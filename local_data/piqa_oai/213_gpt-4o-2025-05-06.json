        "To determine how to create peppermint fudge, let's consider what typically goes into making fudge. Fudge is generally a soft, creamy candy made from sugar, butter, and milk, with chocolate often being the main flavoring component.",
        "Next, let's look at the ingredients mentioned in the choices. Fudge recipes commonly use chocolate and often incorporate ingredients like marshmallow cream to ensure a smooth texture.",
        "In option A, hard chocolate and marshmallows are mixed. Hard chocolate needs to be melted to blend properly into a fudge mixture, so using it in its hard form might not result in the desired smooth consistency.",
        "In option B, melted chocolate and marshmallow cream are mixed. Melting the chocolate is crucial to creating a smooth and cohesive mix, and marshmallow cream is known to give fudge a soft texture. This approach aligns with common fudge-making techniques.",
        "Finally, option B instructs to set the fudge mixture in the fridge, which helps it solidify and reach the proper consistency for serving.",
        "Therefore, option B correctly outlines a practical and effective method for making peppermint fudge."
