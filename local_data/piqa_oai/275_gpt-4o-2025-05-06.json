    "question": "How would you make the round ends of a duct tape bag?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a pencil to trace around a roll of duct tape on a sheet of paper.\nB: Use a pencil to trace around a pair of scissors on a sheet of paper.",
    "steps": [
        "To create round ends for a duct tape bag, you need a circular shape as a template.",
        "A roll of duct tape has a round shape.",
        "By tracing around a roll of duct tape with a pencil on a sheet of paper, you create a perfect circular template for the ends of the bag.",
        "On the other hand, a pair of scissors typically does not have a round shape, so tracing around them would not produce a circular template.",
        "Therefore, the most logical choice is to use a pencil to trace around a roll of duct tape on a sheet of paper.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Use a pencil to trace around a roll of duct tape on a sheet of paper."
