    "question": "microscope\n\nChoices:\nA: can see items that are huge\nB: can see cells that are huge",
    "steps": [
        "A microscope is an instrument that is used to see very small objects that cannot be seen clearly with the naked eye.",
        "The term \"huge\" typically refers to something large in size, but in the context of cells, it means larger than typical microscopic entities yet still small enough to require a microscope.",
        "Huge cells can be magnified and observed under a microscope.",
        "On the other hand, items that are huge in the literal sense do not require a microscope to be seen as they are visible to the naked eye.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: can see cells that are huge."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
