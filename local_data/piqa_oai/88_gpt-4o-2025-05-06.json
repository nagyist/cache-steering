    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for cutting drywall panels, we need to understand the process of cutting drywall precisely and safely.",
        "First, we need to cut through the paper and into the gypsum core using a utility knife. This step is common to both choices A and B.",
        "Next, we should consider how to snap the drywall along the cut line to create a clean break. Supporting the drywall sheet on the back will help maintain the structure and create a precise break along the joint. This step ensures that the drywall doesn't crack or break unevenly.",
        "Finally, after snapping the drywall along the cut line, we need to cut through the paper on the back of the drywall sheet using the utility knife to complete the separation.",
        "Given these steps, choice A is correct as it involves supporting the drywall sheet on the back before applying pressure to the face, ensuring a cleaner and more controlled break along the joint."
