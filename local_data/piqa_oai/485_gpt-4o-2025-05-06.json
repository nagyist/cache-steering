    "steps": [
        "To determine the proper method for making candy apple coating, it's necessary to identify the steps involved and ensure they align with standard candy-making processes.",
        "The choices given mention bringing all the ingredients (except for the red gel and flavorings) to a boil and using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.",
        "Both options describe heating the sugar to the \"hard crack\" stage, which is crucial for achieving the desired texture for candy apples.",
        "Option A indicates the temperature range for the \"hard crack\" stage as 300-510 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Option B mentions the temperature range for the \"hard crack\" stage as 300-310 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Reviewing the standard candy-making temperature stages, the \"hard crack\" stage is typically recognized to occur between 300-310 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Therefore, the temperature range given in Option B (300-310 degrees Fahrenheit) is correct and aligns with candy-making standards.",
        "As Option B properly reflects the correct temperature range for the \"hard crack\" stage, it should be considered the correct process for making candy apple coating.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Put all of the ingredients, except for the red gel and any flavorings, into a pot and bring to a boil. It's a lot easier if you use a candy thermometer to keep an eye on the temperature. You want the sugar to hit the \"hard crack\" stage, usually 300-310 degrees. Just before it does, add your coloring and flavors."
