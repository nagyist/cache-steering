    "question": "How do I create shot glasses made of ice ?\n\nChoices:\nA: Fill a 3 oz plastic cup to 2/3 then place the 10 oz cup inside the 3 oz  cup and push it down until it is about level with the rim of the larger cup. Add a stone in the 1 oz cup to help to weigh it down without sinking. Stabilize the 1 oz cup in the middle with duct tape over the 2 cups. Place inside the freezer 6-8 hours.\nB: Fill a 3 oz plastic cup to 2/3 then place the 1 oz cup inside the 3 oz  cup and push it down until it is about level with the rim of the larger cup.

    "steps": [
        "To create an ice shot glass, you will need a process that allows you to mold and freeze the ice into the shape of a shot glass.",
        "To start, you need to select the appropriate sizes for the cups to mold the ice properly.",
        "The size of the outer cup should be larger so it can hold the ice around the inner cup.",
        "The inner cup should be small enough to create the cavity for the shot glass but still fit inside the larger cup while being stabilized.",
        "Between the choices given, a combination of a 3 oz outer cup and a 1 oz inner cup seems logical for making a small, shot-sized glass of ice that holds together well.",
        "For the process, you should fill the 3 oz cup 2/3 full with water to allow enough room for the inner cup to push down and form the shot glass shape.",
        "Placing the 1 oz cup inside the 3 oz cup and pushing it down until it is level with the rim of the larger cup ensures the cavity space for the shot glass is properly formed.",
        "Adding a stone in the 1 oz cup helps to weigh it down without sinking, which keeps the inner cup stabilized as the water freezes.",
        "Stabilizing the cups further with duct tape ensures they remain properly aligned during the freezing process.",
        "Placing the setup inside the freezer for 6-8 hours allows the water to freeze solid, forming an ice shot glass.",
        "Comparing the choices, B uses the correct sizes (3 oz and 1 oz cups) and correct step process to properly form and freeze ice shot glasses.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B."
