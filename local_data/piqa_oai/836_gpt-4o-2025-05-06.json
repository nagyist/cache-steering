        "When evaluating the options to prevent mud from being tracked in the house, it's important to consider where people typically step before entering the house.",
        "If we place a strip of artificial grass in the lawn, it may reduce some mud, but people will still walk on other areas of the lawn and potentially pick up mud.",
        "By placing the artificial grass directly at the doorway, we ensure that the last thing people step on before entering the house will help clean their shoes of mud.",
        "This direct placement at the doorway effectively minimizes the chances of mud entering the house.",
        "Therefore, the most effective solution to keep mud from being tracked into the house is option B: Put a strip of artificial grass in the doorway."
