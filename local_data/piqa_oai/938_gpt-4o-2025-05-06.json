    "question": "Make a stinky pair of shoes smell good.\n\nChoices:\nA: Toss the shoes in the toilet with a wet fabric softener sheet.\nB: Toss the shoes in the dryer with a wet fabric softener sheet.",
    "steps": [
        "To make a pair of shoes smell good, we need to address the root cause of the odor, which is often bacteria and moisture.",
        "Option A, \"Toss the shoes in the toilet with a wet fabric softener sheet,\" is not a viable solution because immersing shoes in the toilet would introduce more bacteria and moisture, likely worsening the smell and potentially damaging the shoes.",
        "Option B, \"Toss the shoes in the dryer with a wet fabric softener sheet,\" introduces heat and circulation, which can help dry out the shoes and distribute a pleasant scent from the fabric softener sheet. The heat assists in killing some bacteria and eliminating moisture, thus reducing the odor and making the shoes smell better.",
        "Therefore, option B is the more effective method for making a stinky pair of shoes smell good."
