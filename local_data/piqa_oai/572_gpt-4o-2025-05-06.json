    "steps": [
        "Sun damage typically occurs due to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun.",
        "To prevent this damage, a protective barrier should be established on the skin before UV rays can reach it.",
        "Sunscreen acts as this protective barrier by either absorbing or reflecting the harmful UV rays.",
        "Applying sunscreen after exposure does not provide protection against the initial UV damage.",
        "Therefore, sunscreen must be applied before exposing your skin to the sun to effectively prevent sun damage.",
        "This makes the correct answer: A: apply sun screen prior to exposing your skin to the sun."
