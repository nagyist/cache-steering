    "steps": [
        "Glasses can focus sunlight into a small intense point due to the refraction of light.",
        "When sunlight is focused through glasses, the intensity at the focal point increases, making it hot enough to burn materials.",
        "Paper is an easily combustible material and can catch fire when exposed to intense heat, such as from focused sunlight.",
        "Rocks, on the other hand, are not easily combustible and require much higher temperatures to burn than paper does.",
        "Therefore, it is more plausible for paper to burn when sunlight is focused through glasses than for rocks to burn."
