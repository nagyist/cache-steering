    "question": "to repair worn out heel linings of your shoes\n\nChoices:\nA: patch some denim over it  by sewing\nB: patch some plastic piece over it  by gluing",
    "steps": [
        "Identify the materials mentioned in each choice. In Choice A, the material is denim, and in Choice B, the material is plastic.",
        "Next, evaluate the characteristics of each material. Denim is known for its durability, flexibility, and comfort. It can handle wear and tear relatively well and is soft enough to wear against your heel without causing discomfort.",
        "Plastic, on the other hand, might not be as flexible or comfortable as denim and could lead to discomfort when worn against the heel. Additionally, gluing plastic can sometimes lead to a less secure fix compared to sewing denim, which offers a more sturdy and long-lasting repair.",
        "Considering both material effectiveness and comfort, patching denim by sewing (Choice A) is a superior solution for repairing worn out heel linings.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: patch some denim over it by sewing."
