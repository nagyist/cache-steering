    "question": "How to puree strawberries.\n\nChoices:\nA: Combine strawberries and sugar in a dishwasher and blend until smooth. Pour into empty baby food jars.\nB: Combine strawberries and sugar in a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour into empty baby food jars.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the two choices provided for the method of pureeing strawberries. Both options involve combining strawberries and sugar, and then blending until smooth.",
        "The primary difference in the choices is the tool used for blending: a dishwasher in option A and a food processor in option B.",
        "Next, evaluate the practical use of each tool for blending. A dishwasher is not designed for blending or pureeing food; it is intended for cleaning dishes. A food processor, on the other hand, is specifically designed for blending, chopping, and pureeing food.",
        "Considering the functionality and common kitchen practice, a food processor is the appropriate tool for achieving a smooth puree of strawberries and sugar. Therefore, option B logically aligns with the correct method.",
        "Finally, option B suggests pouring the puree into empty baby food jars, which is a plausible step to store the prepared puree.",
        "Based on these reasonings, the correct answer is:"
