        "Consider the problem of making long cuts on narrow boards.",
        "Narrow boards can be difficult to handle safely and accurately when making long cuts.",
        "To address this issue, using a carrier board can provide additional support and stability during the cutting process.",
        "The carrier board should be of the same thickness as the narrow board to ensure uniformity and stability while cutting.",
        "Attaching the carrier board edge to edge with double-sided tape every 6 inches would help in holding the narrow board steady during cutting.",
        "Using double-sided tape allows for a temporary attachment, making it easier to separate the boards later if needed.",
        "Permanent attachment is not ideal because it complicates the process of separating the boards after cutting.",
        "Therefore, the correct solution is to temporarily attach the carrier board using pieces of double-sided tape every 6 inches.",
        "The correct answer is B."
