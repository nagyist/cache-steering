    "steps": [
        "To make a homemade slingshot, you need a stick with a Y shape because the Y shape provides two prongs that can hold a rubber band securely.",
        "Step 1: Find or carve a stick with a Y shape at one end and a handle on the other end. This provides the necessary structure for the slingshot.",
        "Step 2: Tie a rubber band around each end of the Y. This placement of the rubber bands allows for the elasticity needed to launch objects.",
        "The handle serves as the gripping point when pulling back on the rubber band to shoot.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Find or carve a stick with a Y shape at one end and a handle on the other end. Tie a rubber band around each end of the Y."
