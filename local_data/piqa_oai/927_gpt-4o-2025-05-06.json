    "question": "How do you make a pillow with a design you created.\n\nChoices:\nA: Cut out a design from adhesive paper and spray paint the design then remove the paper.\nB: Cut out a design from paper towel and spray paint the design then remove the paper.",
    "steps": [
        "To make a pillow with a specific design, you need to create a stencil that can be applied to the fabric.",
        "Adhesive paper is often used as a stencil material because it sticks to the fabric, creating clean lines and preventing the paint from bleeding outside the design.",
        "Once the adhesive paper stencil is in place, spray paint can be used to fill in the design. The adhesive ensures that only the exposed areas receive the paint.",
        "After the paint has dried, the adhesive paper stencil can be removed, leaving the design on the pillow. This method is precise and effective for creating custom designs on fabric.",
        "Paper towel, on the other hand, is not adhesive and would not stick to the fabric, causing the paint to bleed and resulting in an imprecise design.",
        "Therefore, the most effective and accurate method is using an adhesive paper stencil.",
        "The correct answer is A: Cut out a design from adhesive paper and spray paint the design then remove the paper."
