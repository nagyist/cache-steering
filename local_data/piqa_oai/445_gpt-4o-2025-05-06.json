    "question": "To prevent corrosion on a starter motor\n\nChoices:\nA: Wipe the motor down with an oily rag.\nB: Wipe the motor down with a wet rag.",
    "steps": [
        "Corrosion occurs when moisture and oxygen interact with metal surfaces, leading to rust and degradation.",
        "An oily rag can create a protective barrier that repels moisture and oxygen, thus preventing corrosion.",
        "A wet rag, on the other hand, introduces moisture to the motor, which would increase the likelihood of corrosion.",
        "Therefore, wiping the motor down with an oily rag is more effective at preventing corrosion than using a wet rag."

    "solution": "A"
