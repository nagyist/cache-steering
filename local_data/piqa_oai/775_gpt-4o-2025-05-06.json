    "question": "How do I flatten the cookie dough balls ?\n\nChoices:\nA: Using a toothpick, press balls making a crisscross pattern, flattening each  ball to a 1/2-inch thickness.\nB: Using a fork, press balls making a crisscross pattern, flattening each  ball to a 1/2-inch thickness.",
    "steps": [
        "Cookie dough balls need to be flattened to ensure uniform baking. The usual method involves creating a crisscross pattern which can also enhance the texture of the cookies.",
        "A tool is required to create the pattern and apply enough pressure to flatten each ball to a 1/2-inch thickness.",
        "A toothpick would not provide sufficient surface area or leverage to flatten cookie dough balls effectively.",
        "A fork, however, has a broader surface and is commonly used for pressing cookie dough because it can create the desired crisscross pattern and effectively flatten the dough to the required thickness.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Using a fork, press balls making a crisscross pattern, flattening each ball to a 1/2-inch thickness."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
