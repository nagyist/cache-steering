    "question": "To make use out of a torn pair of jeans that are torn below the knee,\n\nChoices:\nA: turn the pair of jeans into a t shirt by putting the pant sleeves over your arms.\nB: turn the pair of jeans into cut off shorts by cutting off the bottom half of the jeans.",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the practicality of each option. Turning a pair of jeans into a T-shirt by putting the pant sleeves over your arms is impractical and unlikely to function as intended.",
        "Second, examine the feasibility of cutting the jeans. Cutting off the bottom half of the jeans to turn them into cut-off shorts is a common and practical approach to repurposing torn jeans.",
        "Third, take into account the location of the tear. Since the jeans are torn below the knee, cutting them into shorts removes the torn section, leaving the top part intact and wearable.",
        "Therefore, the correct and practical answer to repurpose the torn jeans is: turn the pair of jeans into cut-off shorts by cutting off the bottom half of the jeans."

    "solution": "B"
