    "question": "To harvest the honey out of a honeycomb tray,\n\nChoices:\nA: place the bees into a centrifuge device and run until all the honey has dripped out.\nB: place the tray into a centrifuge device and run until all the honey has dripped out.",
    "steps": [
        "Honey is stored by bees in honeycombs, which are tray-like structures made from beeswax.",
        "To harvest honey, you need to extract it from these honeycombs.",
        "Using a centrifuge device is a common method to extract honey from honeycombs.",
        "Placing the tray containing the honeycomb into the centrifuge will cause the honey to drip out due to centrifugal force.",
        "Placing bees into a centrifuge device would not make sense as the honey is in the honeycombs, not inside the bees and centrifuging bees would be harmful to them.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: place the tray into a centrifuge device and run until all the honey has dripped out."

    "solution": "B"
