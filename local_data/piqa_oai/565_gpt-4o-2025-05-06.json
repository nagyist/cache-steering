    "question": "How to make a box hard to store delicates?\n\nChoices:\nA: Rub glue onto the box and stick newspaper to it, then mix glue with water and spread that onto the newspaper and let it dry\nB: Rub glue onto some newspaper and stick the box to it, then mix glue with newspaper and spread that onto the box and let it dry",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the goal of the process: making a box hard to store delicates. The key to achieving this involves steps that reinforce the box.",
        "Choice A involves applying glue onto the box and sticking newspaper to it, which will create a layer that adds strength to the box.",
        "Then, mixing glue with water and spreading it onto the newspaper further reinforces the structure as the glue mixture dries and hardens, forming a tougher surface.",
        "Choice B suggests applying glue to newspaper first and then sticking the box to it. This method is less effective because the newspaper won't adhere as strongly to the box if glued beforehand.",
        "Moreover, mixing glue with newspaper to spread onto the box does not create the same reinforcing layer as the mixture of glue and water applied in Choice A.",
        "Therefore, Choice A is the correct answer, as it properly strengthens the box for storing delicates."
