    "steps": [
        "When drying clothes in a dryer, the key is to absorb as much moisture as possible from the wet clothes.",
        "A dry towel can help by absorbing some of the moisture from the wet clothes, which reduces the overall moisture content in the dryer.",
        "Since the dry towel absorbs some of the wetness, the dryer doesn't have to work as hard or as long to evaporate the moisture from the clothes.",
        "This results in a significant reduction in drying time, potentially reducing the time by almost half.",
        "On the other hand, adding a wet towel would increase the overall moisture content and make the drying process longer.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is to throw a dry towel into the dryer with your wet clothes. This reduces the drying time significantly."
