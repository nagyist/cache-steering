    "steps": [
        "Consider the effectiveness of using a dog versus a flyer for home protection.",
        "A dog can physically and audibly deter intruders.",
        "A barking dog can alert homeowners and neighbors to the presence of an intruder.",
        "Dogs can provide a continuous level of protection and responsiveness.",
        "Flyers may not be as effective because they can be ignored or disregarded by intruders.",
        "There is also no guarantee that a flyer will instill fear or deter a determined intruder.",
        "Hence, a dog provides a reliable and active means of protection, while a flyer offers passive and less assured protection.",
        "Therefore, the best choice to protect your home from invasions is option A: get a dog to bark when an intruder arrives."
