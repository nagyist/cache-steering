    "question": "how to lock a tape measure.\n\nChoices:\nA: after extending the tape to the desired length, pull the front locking tab up until it locks into place.\nB: after extending the tape to the desired length, press the front locking tab down until it locks into place.",
    "steps": [
        "First, we identify the action needed to lock the tape measure after extending it.",
        "We know that tape measure mechanisms typically have a locking tab that holds the tape in place when engaged.",
        "We analyze the two choices: choice A suggests pulling the front locking tab up, while choice B suggests pressing the front locking tab down.",
        "We consider common designs of tape measures, where the locking mechanism usually involves pressing down the tab to secure the tape.",
        "Based on standard functionality of tape measures, pressing the tab down (Choice B) is the correct method to engage the lock.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: after extending the tape to the desired length, press the front locking tab down until it locks into place."
