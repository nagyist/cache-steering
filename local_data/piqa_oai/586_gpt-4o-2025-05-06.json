    "steps": [
        "To create a pattern for the bodice part of a sleeveless dress, one needs to start with a fitting garment that has a similar shape to the bodice.",
        "A t-shirt that fits well already has the upper body design similar to a bodice, making it easier to use as a pattern once the sleeves are removed.",
        "On the other hand, pants do not resemble the shape of a bodice, even if the legs are cut off. The resulting shape would not be useful for creating a dress bodice pattern.",
        "Therefore, cutting the sleeves off a well-fitting t-shirt would provide a more appropriate base for making a bodice pattern of a sleeveless dress.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Cut the sleeves off a t-shirt that fits well and use that."
