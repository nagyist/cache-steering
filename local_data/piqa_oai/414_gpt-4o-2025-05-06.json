        "First, consider the physical properties of a rock.",
        "A rock is typically a solid object, which can vary in size.",
        "Next, consider the scenarios provided in the choices.",
        "\"Can go up my sleeve\" implies that the rock is small enough to fit into a sleeve.",
        "\"Can go up my flour\" is not a common phrase and does not make logical sense. Flour is a powdery substance usually used in cooking, and the concept of a rock fitting into flour doesn\u2019t align with common usage.",
        "Therefore, we can deduce that the more plausible choice is that a rock can go up your sleeve."
