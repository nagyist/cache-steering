    "steps": [
        "To identify the correct choice, first consider the primary function of a cardboard box.",
        "Cardboard boxes are typically used for packaging, storage, and transportation purposes due to their structure and capacity to hold items.",
        "Next, analyze the choices in terms of their compatibility with the primary function of a cardboard box. Choice A suggests the box can coat a pipe, which would imply using the box material to cover or wrap around a pipe. This is not a typical use of cardboard as it is not designed for coating or wrapping tightly around objects.",
        "Choice B suggests the box can transport a pipe, which aligns with the primary function of a cardboard box. The box can serve as a container to hold and safely transport the pipe from one location to another.",
        "Therefore, Choice B is the correct answer as it matches the intended use of a cardboard box."
