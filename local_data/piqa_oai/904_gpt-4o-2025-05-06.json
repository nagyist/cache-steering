    "question": "What type of ground beef should I select when making hamburgers\n\nChoices:\nA: You should select 100% fat ground beef so they are juicier\nB: You should select 20% fat ground beef so they are juicier",
    "steps": [
        "Ground beef is available in various fat percentages, and the fat content affects the juiciness and flavor of the cooked meat.",
        "100% fat ground beef would be impractical and does not exist as it would not hold any meat content.",
        "20% fat ground beef, also known as 80/20 ground beef, means it contains 80% lean meat and 20% fat. This is generally considered enough fat to impart juiciness and flavor without causing excessive greasiness.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice is B: You should select 20% fat ground beef so they are juicier."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
