    "steps": [
        "Rust on a bike chain is a common issue caused by moisture and exposure to elements.",
        "Lubricating a bike chain helps to create a protective barrier against moisture and reduces friction.",
        "Candle wax, when used as a chain lube, forms a coating that can help prevent rust by repelling water and providing a smoother surface for chain movement.",
        "A candle wick, on the other hand, does not provide any effective lubrication or protection against rust.",
        "Therefore, using candle wax as chain lube is a more effective method for preventing rust on the bike chain."
