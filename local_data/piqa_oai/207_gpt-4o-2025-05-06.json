    "question": "To open a salt packet.\n\nChoices:\nA: Tear the packer open in the middle.\nB: Tear the packet open near the top.",
    "steps": [
        "To solve this question, I need to consider the practical and common way people open small packets like salt packets.",
        "A typical salt packet is a small, tightly sealed paper or plastic container that holds a small quantity of salt.",
        "Tearing the packet open in the middle (Option A) runs the risk of spilling the contents uncontrollably because the tear doesn't leave a good opening for pouring out the salt.",
        "On the other hand, tearing the packet open near the top (Option B) is a more controlled method. It creates a small opening, making it easier to pour the desired amount of salt without spilling too much.",
        "Therefore, the most common and practical method to open a salt packet is to tear it open near the top.",
        "Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is B: Tear the packet open near the top."
