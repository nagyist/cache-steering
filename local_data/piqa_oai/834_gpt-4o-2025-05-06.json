    "question": "To tenderize and flatten a steak, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Place the steak inside a plastic bag and use a metal file to beat the steak\nB: Place the steak inside a plastic bag and use a metal mallet to beat the steak",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to understand the goal, which is to tenderize and flatten a steak.",
        "Tenderizing and flattening a steak involves breaking down the muscle fibers to make it easier to chew and also to ensure it cooks evenly.",
        "Using a metal file is not a conventional or safe kitchen method for tenderizing meat. Metal files are tools more suitable for woodworking or metalwork and are not intended or safe for use with food.",
        "In contrast, a metal mallet or meat tenderizer is a specifically designed kitchen tool for this purpose. It has a flat and/or textured surface for pounding the meat, making it easier to tenderize and flatten the steak efficiently.",
        "Placing the steak inside a plastic bag before using the mallet is recommended to prevent splattering and keep the working area clean.",
        "Based on these points, the most appropriate choice to tenderize and flatten a steak is to use a metal mallet.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: B: Place the steak inside a plastic bag and use a metal mallet to beat the steak."
