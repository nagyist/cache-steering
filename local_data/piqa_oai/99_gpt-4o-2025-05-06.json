    "question": "To determine if someone has romantic feelings for you,\n\nChoices:\nA: ensure that the person seems very quiet and reserved around you.\nB: observe if their body language seems really open and excited to you.",
    "steps": [
        "To determine if someone has romantic feelings for you, you need to look for signs that indicate their interest and attraction.",
        "One way to gauge this is by observing their body language, as it often reveals feelings that may not be expressed verbally.",
        "If someone is displaying open and excited body language, it typically means they are comfortable and happy around you.",
        "Being open and excited in their body language, such as facing you, making eye contact, and having animated gestures, are positive signs that they might have romantic feelings for you.",
        "On the other hand, being very quiet and reserved might indicate discomfort or lack of interest, rather than romantic feelings.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: observe if their body language seems really open and excited to you."

    "solution": "B"
