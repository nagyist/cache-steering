    "steps": [
        "Chilling cookie dough before baking can improve its texture and flavor.",
        "Chilling the dough allows the fats to solidify, which can prevent spreading during baking and create thicker cookies.",
        "Chilling the dough can also hydrate the flour, which can improve the overall consistency of the cookies.",
        "Freezing cookie dough is often used for longer-term storage rather than short-term improvements in texture.",
        "Typically, a brief chill, such as 30 minutes, is done in the refrigerator rather than the freezer.",
        "Therefore, the recommendation for chilling the cookie dough for 30 minutes should be in the fridge."
