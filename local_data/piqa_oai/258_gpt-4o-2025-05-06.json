    "question": "Jug\n\nChoices:\nA: can hold over a gallon of cold spring water to serve\nB: can hold boiling scalding hot water to serve",
    "steps": [
        "First, we need to think about the typical use and characteristics of a jug.",
        "Jugs are generally used to store and serve liquids such as water, milk, or juice.",
        "It is common for jugs to hold cold liquids like spring water.",
        "While some jugs might be able to hold boiling water, it is not a typical use or characteristic that is commonly associated with jugs.",
        "Therefore, the more appropriate choice would be related to storing and serving cold water.",
        "Evaluating both choices, A seems to fit the typical use of a jug better.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: can hold over a gallon of cold spring water to serve."
