    "steps": [
        "To determine whether a ski pole can be thrown like a spear or a frisbee, we must consider the physical characteristics of a ski pole.",
        "A ski pole is long, thin, and generally straight, which is similar to the shape of a spear.",
        "Ski poles are designed to be held in a manner similar to how spears are held, allowing them to be thrown with a forward motion.",
        "Frisbees, on the other hand, are flat and round, designed to be thrown with a spinning motion.",
        "The shape and design of a ski pole does not allow it to be thrown effectively with a spinning motion, which rules out the frisbee manner.",
        "Therefore, it is accurate to say that a ski pole can be thrown like a spear."
