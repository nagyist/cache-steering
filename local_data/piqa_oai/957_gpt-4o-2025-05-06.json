    "question": "bottle opener\n\nChoices:\nA: can open books easily\nB: can open canned food easily",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider the function of a bottle opener. It is a tool designed for opening certain types of sealed containers.",
        "Bottle openers typically apply leverage to the cap of a bottle to pry it off. Therefore, it is useful for opening bottles or containers with similar sealed mechanisms.",
        "Next, evaluate the choices given. Option A states that a bottle opener \"can open books easily.\" This is incorrect because books do not have sealed caps or tops that need to be pried off.",
        "Option B states that a bottle opener \"can open canned food easily.\" While bottle openers are not typically used explicitly for canned food, they can indeed be used to open soda bottles or beer bottles, which might be considered a type of canned beverage.",
        "Additionally, if we interpret \"canned food\" broadly to mean any type of sealed container (such as bottled beverages), then a bottle opener can indeed open these types of containers easily.",
        "Given the options, the best interpretation aligns with Option B since it pertains to opening containers, which is the primary function of a bottle opener.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: can open canned food easily."
