    "steps": [
        "First, identify the proper tool for spreading frosting. A whisk is typically used for mixing ingredients and not for spreading. It wouldn't be effective for spreading frosting evenly.",
        "Next, consider the rubber spatula. Rubber spatulas are designed to scrape and spread mixtures smoothly and evenly, making them suitable for frosting a cake.",
        "The rubber spatula allows for more control over the spreading process, making it easier to cover the entire surface of the cake evenly.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is: Scoop frosting with a rubber spatula and spread evenly over the top of the cake."
