    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct choice for making the forms, we need to consider the practicality and the typical use of the materials involved.",
        "A ruler is generally flat and does not lend itself well to being wrapped in card stock to form a cylindrical shape.",
        "A pencil, on the other hand, is cylindrical and can easily be wrapped in card stock to form a cylindrical shape, which is likely the intended form.",
        "After wrapping the card stock around a pencil, wrapping it in tape would secure the shape, making it a more feasible and practical solution.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is:\nA: Cut 10 centimeters of card stock and wrap it around a pencil then wrap that in tape."
