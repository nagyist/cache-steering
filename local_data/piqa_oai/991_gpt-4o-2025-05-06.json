    "question": "Catch dust from drilling.\n\nChoices:\nA: Bend a post it note over hole.\nB: Bend a post it note under hole.",
    "steps": [
        "When drilling, dust falls downward due to gravity.",
        "To catch the dust effectively, you need a surface or container positioned below the hole to collect falling particles.",
        "Bending a post-it note under the hole creates a small makeshift container that can catch the dust as it falls.",
        "Bending a post-it note over the hole would not catch the dust effectively as the dust is falling downwards and needs to be caught from below.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Bend a post it note under hole."
    ],
    "solution": "B"
