    "question": "To make it easier to trace a pattern onto another piece of paper, you can\n\nChoices:\nA: Use a dark room with as little light as possible so that you can see what you're tracing\nB: Use a table lamp to produce as much light as possible so you can see what you're tracing",
    "steps": [
        "Tracing a pattern onto another piece of paper requires visibility to ensure accuracy.",
        "To achieve clear visibility, adequate lighting is necessary so that the pattern and the paper are easily seen.",
        "In a dark room with minimal light, it would be difficult to see the pattern clearly.",
        "A table lamp, which provides a concentrated and adjustable source of light, can illuminate the pattern and the paper effectively.",
        "Using a table lamp to produce as much light as possible will make the tracing process easier and more accurate compared to using a dark room with little light.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: Use a table lamp to produce as much light as possible so you can see what you're tracing."
