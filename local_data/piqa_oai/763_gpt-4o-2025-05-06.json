        "To get the most meat off a pineapple, you need to start by removing the top part of the pineapple, which includes the spikes.",
        "Next, cut off the bottom part of the pineapple so it has a stable, flat surface to stand on.",
        "When slicing the sides, you want to enter the fruit\u2019s peel at an angle to minimize the amount of pineapple meat you remove along with the peel.",
        "Grinding off the sides may remove excessive amounts of the pineapple's flesh along with the peel, whereas slicing at an angle ensures you retain more of the fruit.",
        "Therefore, the correct approach is to twist the top spikes off, cut the bottom part to have an even stand, and slice off the sides, entering the fruit\u2019s peel at an angle."
