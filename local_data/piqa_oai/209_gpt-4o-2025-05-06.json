        "To determine the correct method for building a compost bin, it's important to understand the basic principles of composting.",
        "Composting involves the natural breakdown of organic materials to create nutrient-rich soil.",
        "Key components of a compost bin typically include 'greens' (nitrogen-rich materials) and 'browns' (carbon-rich materials).",
        "Common 'green' materials include vegetable scraps and grass clippings, while 'brown' materials include dead leaves, straw, and cardboard.",
        "Dirt is often used in compost bins to add necessary microbes that assist with the decomposition process.",
        "Dead skin is not a common or recommended composting material, and it can lead to unpleasant odors or attract pests.",
        "Dead leaves, on the other hand, are an excellent 'brown' material and commonly recommended in composting guidelines.",
        "Option A suggests using dead skin, which is not suitable for composting. Therefore, it can be eliminated.",
        "Option B suggests using dead leaves, which is correct and suitable for the composting process.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is B: fill the bin with alternating layers of dirt and dead leaves."
