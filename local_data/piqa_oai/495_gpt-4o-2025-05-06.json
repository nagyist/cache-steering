    "question": "Seal paper to cardboard.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use white glue on top and bottom of paper.\nB: Use decoupage glue on top and bottom of paper.",
    "steps": [
        "First, understand the requirement of the task, which is to seal paper to cardboard.",
        "Identify the choices given: Choice A (Use white glue on top and bottom of paper) and Choice B (Use decoupage glue on top and bottom of paper).",
        "Consider the properties and uses of both types of glues: White glue is often used for basic adhesion tasks, while decoupage glue is specifically designed for sealing and securing paper to surfaces, providing a clear and permanent finish.",
        "Decoupage glue is versatile as it can be used both as an adhesive and a sealant, ensuring the paper is not only attached but also thoroughly sealed to the cardboard.",
        "White glue typically does not provide the same level of sealing and finish as decoupage glue, which can lead to issues like peeling or damage over time.",
        "Therefore, for the task of sealing paper to cardboard properly and ensuring a lasting finish, the better choice is Choice B: Use decoupage glue on top and bottom of paper.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is clearly B."
