    "steps": [
        "To stabilize a table, the goal is to ensure it stands firmly and does not wobble.",
        "If the table is wobbling, it might be because one or more of its legs are not level with the others.",
        "Adding washers to the bottom of the legs can help to level the legs and thus stabilize the table.",
        "Ensuring that washers are flat (Option A) does not directly address the issue of the table's stability. It is more about the condition of the washers rather than their positioning to fix wobbling.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: add washers to bottom."

    "solution": "B"
