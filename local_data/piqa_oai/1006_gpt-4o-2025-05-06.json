    "question": "To secure a patch placed on denim for sewing.\n\nChoices:\nA: Use tape along the perimeter of the patch to prevent it from moving during sewing.\nB: Use a glue stick along the back of the patch to prevent it from moving during sewing.",
    "steps": [
        "First, identify the goal of the task, which is to secure a patch placed on denim to ensure it doesn't move during sewing.",
        "Consider option A: Using tape along the perimeter of the patch. Tape can be cumbersome and might not adhere well to the fabric, making it less effective in keeping the patch stable. Tape could also interfere with the sewing process or leave residue on the fabric.",
        "Next, evaluate option B: Using a glue stick along the back of the patch. The glue from a glue stick can provide a temporary adhesive that holds the patch securely in place against the fabric, which is typically enough stability for sewing.",
        "Recognize that glue sticks are designed to be fabric-friendly and typically do not leave a permanent mark or residue, making them suitable for this task. The glue can hold the patch in place without interfering with the sewing process.",
        "Therefore, given its strong temporary hold and fabric-friendly properties, using a glue stick along the back of the patch (option B) is the more appropriate and effective choice for preventing the patch from moving during sewing.",
        "The correct answer is B."
