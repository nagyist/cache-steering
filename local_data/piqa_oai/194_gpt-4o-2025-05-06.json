    "steps": [
        "To cool off a home effectively, increasing air circulation is crucial.",
        "The goal is to create a cross-breeze that moves hot air out and brings cool air in.",
        "Placing one fan in a window to pull cooler outside air in is the first step.",
        "Placing another fan in a window opposite to blow out the warmer inside air enhances the cross-breeze effect.",
        "This setup ensures that hot air is expelled from the home and replaced by cooler air from outside.",
        "Option A suggests circulating air within the home, which would not remove the hot air effectively.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B, which ensures effective air circulation by bringing cooler air in and pushing hot air out."
