    "steps": [
        "When trying to differentiate twins, you need a method that reliably distinguishes one from the other.",
        "Option B, \"make sure they don't wash their face,\" suggests using dirt or temporary markings, which can be easily removed or fade over time.",
        "On the other hand, Option A, \"mark one on face,\" implies placing a mark that is more likely to be deliberate and lasting, making it a more reliable method for differentiation.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: mark one on face."
