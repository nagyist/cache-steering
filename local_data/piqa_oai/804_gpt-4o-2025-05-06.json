    "steps": [
        "Identifying the end of masking tape can be difficult because it tends to adhere closely to the roll. To make the end easier to find, one can use methods to soften the adhesive or tape itself.",
        "Placing the masking tape in the microwave for a few seconds can warm it up. The heat can help soften the adhesive, making the tape easier to peel and the end easier to locate.",
        "The freezer, in contrast, typically hardens materials, making the adhesive stiffer and potentially more difficult to work with.",
        "Therefore, the optimal solution to find the end of masking tape is to soften it by placing it in the microwave for a few seconds.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is A: Soften it up by placing it in the microwave for a few seconds."
