    "question": "How can I organize screws and nuts and small items in my garage?\n\nChoices:\nA: Use an old muffin tin, label items with tape in each compartment for ease in finding.\nB: Use an old pie tin, label items with tape in each compartment for ease in finding.",
    "steps": [
        "Consider the shape and functionality of the muffin tin. A muffin tin has multiple small compartments, which are perfect for separating and organizing small items like screws and nuts.",
        "Each compartment in a muffin tin is isolated from the others, preventing the small items from mixing together, making it easy to find what you need.",
        "By labeling each compartment with tape, it becomes even more convenient to identify and retrieve specific items, enhancing the organization.",
        "Compare this with an old pie tin. A pie tin typically has a singular, flat compartment, which would not provide the same level of separation or organization for small items like screws and nuts.",
        "Therefore, the better choice for organizing small items is the option that provides multiple compartments and allows for easy labeling.",
        "Hence, the correct answer is A: Use an old muffin tin, label items with tape in each compartment for ease in finding."
