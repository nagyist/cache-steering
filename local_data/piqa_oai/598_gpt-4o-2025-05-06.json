    "steps": [
        "First, consider the task at hand: sealing the edges of homemade ravioli.",
        "This involves ensuring that the filling stays securely inside the pasta and does not leak out during cooking.",
        "Forks are commonly used in cooking to crimp or press down on the edges of filled pasta or pastry to create a seal because the tines of a fork can press the dough together effectively.",
        "Scissors, on the other hand, are typically used for cutting, not sealing. Scoring edges with scissors would not achieve the purpose of pressing the dough together to create a tight seal.",
        "Therefore, crimping the edges together with a fork is the appropriate method to ensure the ravioli is properly sealed."
