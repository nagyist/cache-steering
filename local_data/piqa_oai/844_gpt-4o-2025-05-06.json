    "question": "compact disc\n\nChoices:\nA: can be played in a jail cell \nB: can be played in a car ",
    "steps": [
        "First, consider what a compact disc is. A compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc storage format.",
        "Next, think of the devices typically used to play compact discs. Common CD players include home stereos, portable CD players, computers with CD drives, and car stereos.",
        "Then, analyze the environment suggested by each choice. A car commonly has a built-in CD player. In contrast, a jail cell typically does not come with a CD player due to security and simplicity considerations.",
        "Therefore, a more likely scenario for playing a CD is in a car, considering the availability of CD players in cars. Thus the correct answer is B: can be played in a car."
