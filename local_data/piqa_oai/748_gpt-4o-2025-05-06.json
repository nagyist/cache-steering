    "question": "To wrap yarn around an entire cable\n\nChoices:\nA: Start at one end of the cable and with your crochet hook in front of the cable wrap the yarn over it and draw the yarn with the hook to create a loop or a chain stitch. Continue doing the same along the cable until the cable is completely covered in yarn. Cut the yarn and tie it off.\nB: Start at one end of the cable and with your crochet hook in front of the yarn wrap the yarn over it and draw the yarn with the hook to create a loop or a chain stitch. Tie the yarn to the cable and go to the other end of the cable and wrap the yarn around it. Cut the yarn and tie it off.",

        "To determine the correct method to wrap yarn around an entire cable, we need to analyze the steps involved in each choice.",
        "Choice A: \n1. Start at one end of the cable.\n2. With the crochet hook in front of the cable, wrap the yarn over it.\n3. Draw the yarn with the hook to create a loop or a chain stitch.\n4. Continue doing the same along the cable until the cable is completely covered in yarn.\n5. Cut the yarn and tie it off.",
        "Choice B: \n1. Start at one end of the cable.\n2. With the crochet hook in front of the yarn, wrap the yarn over it.\n3. Draw the yarn with the hook to create a loop or a chain stitch.\n4. Tie the yarn to the cable.\n5. Go to the other end of the cable and wrap the yarn around it.\n6. Cut the yarn and tie it off.",
        "Key differences:\n- Choice A involves uniformly wrapping the yarn around the cable continuously from one end to the other until the entire cable is covered.\n- Choice B involves initially tying the yarn to the cable, then wrapping it from one end to the other without continuous stitching along the cable.",
        "Because wrapping the yarn along the cable continuously until it is completely covered will ensure a more uniform coverage and include the continuous stitching process as mentioned, Choice A appears to be the correct method.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is:\nA: Start at one end of the cable and with your crochet hook in front of the cable wrap the yarn over it and draw the yarn with the hook to create a loop or a chain stitch. Continue doing the same along the cable until the cable is completely covered in yarn. Cut the yarn and tie it off."
