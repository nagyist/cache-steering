        "When parking in a sunny area, the sunlight can make the top part of the steering wheel very hot.",
        "Turning the steering wheel 180 degrees will put the currently shaded part on top, and when you return to the car, that part will be cooler because it was in the shade while the car was parked.",
        "Turning the steering wheel 360 degrees will return the wheel to its original position, so the top part that was exposed to sunlight will still be hot.",
        "Therefore, turning the steering wheel 180 degrees is the correct method to ensure the top part of the wheel is shaded and cooler when you come back."
