    "question": "how do I identify Certus constellation\n\nChoices:\nA: Cetus is the fourth largest constellation, visible in the months around September just to the south of the ecliptic. Despite its size, Cetus has few bright stars, and because it lies far from the plane of the Milky Way, it also has few deep sky objects.\nB: Cetus is the fourth largest constellation, visible in the months around September just to the south and north of the ecliptic. Despite its size, Cetus has few bright stars, and because it lies far from the plane of the Milky Way, it also has few deep sky objects.",
    "steps": [
        "First, let's identify what the question is asking for. The question asks how to identify the Cetus constellation and provides two similar options describing Cetus. Our task is to examine both options and choose the one that contains accurate and complete information.",
        "To start, we know that Cetus is a prominent constellation known for its size. Both options A and B correctly describe Cetus as the fourth largest constellation.",
        "Next, we need to consider the visibility of the constellation. Cetus is visible in the months around September, which both options A and B mention accurately.",
        "Now we look at the position of Cetus relative to the ecliptic. Option A mentions that Cetus is visible \"just to the south of the ecliptic,\" while Option B states it is visible \"just to the south and north of the ecliptic.\" This is a critical difference.",
        "In truth, Cetus is primarily located to the south of the ecliptic. Therefore, the description in Option A is more accurate in terms of its position.",
        "Finally, both options note that Cetus has few bright stars and is situated far from the plane of the Milky Way, resulting in few deep sky objects. Both of these details are correct.",
        "Given the accurate position relative to the ecliptic, Option A is the correct choice. It provides a precise description of Cetus's location and matches known astronomical information.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is:\nA: Cetus is the fourth largest constellation, visible in the months around September just to the south of the ecliptic. Despite its size, Cetus has few bright stars, and because it lies far from the plane of the Milky Way, it also has few deep sky objects."
