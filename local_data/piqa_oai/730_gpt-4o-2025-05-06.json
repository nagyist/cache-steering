    "question": "how do you give a surprise party?\n\nChoices:\nA: plan a party the person doesn't know about and then suprise them when they get there.\nB: throw a party for someone and have them show up ready.",
    "steps": [
        "Understanding the concept of a 'surprise party' is the first step. A surprise party is one where the guest of honor is unaware of the party and should be surprised upon arrival.",
        "Review the choices provided: \nA: plan a party the person doesn't know about and then surprise them when they get there.\nB: throw a party for someone and have them show up ready.",
        "Evaluate Choice A: Planning a party that the person doesn't know about ensures they are genuinely surprised upon arrival, which fits the definition of a 'surprise party'.",
        "Evaluate Choice B: If you throw a party and have the person show up ready, they are already aware of the party, which defeats the purpose of it being a surprise.",
        "Comparing both choices, it is clear that only Choice A fulfills the requirement of a surprise party where the person is unsuspecting and then gets surprised upon arrival.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: plan a party the person doesn't know about and then surprise them when they get there."
