    "steps": [
        "First, to prepare a canvas for acrylic painting, it is necessary to ensure that the canvas is properly stretched and free from dust and debris.",
        "Second, a sealant or primer is typically used to prevent the canvas from absorbing too much paint, which can dull the colors.",
        "Third, lacquer is not typically used for priming canvases for acrylic painting; it may be more suitable for finishing or protecting an already painted surface.",
        "Fourth, gesso is a traditional and widely recommended primer for canvases when using acrylic paints. It creates a smooth, even surface and helps to enhance the vibrancy of the paint colors by preventing excessive absorption.",
        "Lastly, given the choices, option B correctly involves the use of gesso, which is the appropriate primer for acrylic painting preparation.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B: Make sure the canvas is properly stretched and clean from dust and debris. Use a wide brush and apply a thin layer of gesso paint over the entire canvas and let dry. Now your canvas will be able to showcase the colours you choose and lose none because of an absorbant canvas."
