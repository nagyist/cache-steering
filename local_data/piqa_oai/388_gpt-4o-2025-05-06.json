        "First, let's understand the process of using a Zip-It to unclog hair from a bathroom drain.",
        "The Zip-It is a tool designed specifically for pulling out clogs from bathroom drains. Its long and slender shape allows it to reach deep into the drain.",
        "The small barbs on the sides of the Zip-It catch onto hair and other debris as you insert it into the drain.",
        "To effectively remove the clog, you need to pull the Zip-It gently upward so that the barbs can bring the caught debris out of the drain.",
        "Choice A suggests leaving the Zip-It in the drain, which would not effectively remove the clogs as the tool is designed for manual pulling.",

        "Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B."
