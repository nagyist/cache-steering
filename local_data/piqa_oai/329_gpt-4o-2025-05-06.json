    "question": "To add a light inside a lamp.\n\nChoices:\nA: Get wire with a plug, and chain, and feed the chain on. Then put on a washer -this should be decently big, and this is how the shade part will be attached. Then tape the wire to the socket, and screw in the bulb. CFLs don't get very hot, so go with one of those.\nB: Get wire with a plug, and chain, and feed the chain on.

    "steps": [
        "First, you obtain wire with a plug and chain. These components are essential for conducting electricity and physically supporting the lamp.",
        "Then, you feed the chain onto the wire. This step ensures that your lamp's structure and functionality are properly integrated.",
        "Next, you put on a washer, which plays a critical role in attaching the shade part of the lamp securely.",
        "At this point, you need to connect the wire to the socket. This is where the difference between the choices becomes important.",
        "Choice A suggests taping the wire to the socket, whereas Choice B suggests soldering the wire to the socket. Soldering provides a much more secure and reliable electrical connection compared to taping, which can come loose or fail over time.",
        "Finally, you screw in the bulb. CFL bulbs are recommended because they don't get very hot, reducing the risk of overheating or fire hazards.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is B, which includes the safer and more reliable method of soldering the wire to the socket."
