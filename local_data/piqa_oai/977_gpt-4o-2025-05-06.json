    "steps": [
        "Creating an Easter basket usually involves filling the basket with items that represent Easter traditions, such as candy, chocolates, and decorations.",
        "Option A provides a detailed step-by-step process of starting with a rattan basket, adding fake grass, and then filling it with various kinds of candy and chocolates, which are typical Easter basket contents.",
        "Option B focuses more on decorating the basket itself rather than filling it with traditional Easter items. While painting a bunny and eggs and spraying it with finishing spray adds aesthetic value, it doesn't specify filling it with candy and chocolates.",
        "The question specifically asks for creating an Easter basket, implying both the creation and the filling of the basket with traditional Easter items.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is Option A because it covers the creation of the basket and includes filling it with candy and chocolates, which aligns more closely with the traditional concept of an Easter basket."
