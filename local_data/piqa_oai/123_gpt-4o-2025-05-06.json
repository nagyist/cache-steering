    "question": "How do you open a gift without ripping the paper?\n\nChoices:\nA: Hold gift over boiling water to let the steam release the tape adhesive.\nB: Hold gift over cold water to let the steam release the tape adhesive.",
    "steps": [
        "In order to open a gift without ripping the paper, the adhesive that is holding the wrapping paper needs to be softened.",
        "One effective method to soften adhesive is through the application of steam.",
        "Steam is generated by boiling water, as the heat causes water to vaporize.",
        "By holding the gift over boiling water, the steam produced can penetrate the adhesive, making it easier to peel off without ripping the paper.",
        "Holding the gift over cold water will not produce steam, as cold water does not vaporize; therefore, it will not help in softening the adhesive.",
        "Therefore, the correct method to open a gift without ripping the paper involves holding it over boiling water."
