    "steps": [
        "To determine how to keep meatloaf from falling apart when it\u2019s cooked, we need to understand the properties of the ingredients listed in the choices.",
        "First, let's consider oatmeal. Oatmeal is known to absorb moisture and swell, which gives it the property to bind ingredients together when cooked. This makes it a good addition to dishes like meatloaf to provide structure and prevent it from being crumbly.",
        "Next, let's look at cereal. Cereal typically refers to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, which are often processed and may contain added sugar. They may not have the same binding properties as oatmeal due to their processing and additional ingredients. This makes them less effective in keeping meatloaf from falling apart.",
        "Given these observations, the ingredient that best helps bind meatloaf together to prevent it from becoming crumbly is oatmeal.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer is A: Oatmeal is great to add to meatloaf, it helps bind the loaf together (so it isn't 'crumbly')."
