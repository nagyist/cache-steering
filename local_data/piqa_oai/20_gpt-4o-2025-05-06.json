    "question": "Convert unused paint to solid waste.\n\nChoices:\nA: Pour cat litter into paint can.\nB: Pour cat waste into paint can.",
    "steps": [
        "Unused paint is typically a liquid. To convert it into solid waste, a process must be employed that changes its physical state from liquid to solid.",
        "Cat litter is a substance designed to absorb moisture and liquids, making it ideal for solidifying paint.",
        "Pouring cat litter into the paint can will absorb the liquid paint and turn it into a more solid, clumped form that can be disposed of more easily.",
        "Cat waste, on the other hand, does not have properties that can absorb and solidify paint effectively.",
        "Therefore, the correct choice for converting unused paint to solid waste is to pour cat litter into the paint can."
