    "steps": [
        "To determine the correct method for pinning down two pieces of aligned fabric, we should consider what clothes pins are designed for and how they function.",
        "Typically, clothes pins are used to hold fabric in place by pushing through the fabric, rotating, and then push back through to secure it.",
        "Option A states that after pushing through both pieces of fabric, you should turn the clothes pin towards you before pushing it back through and repeating the process until the fabric is secured. This maneuver would help to fasten the fabric by creating a secure hold.",
        "Option B states that you should turn the clothes pin away from you after pushing through both pieces of fabric before pushing it back through and repeating the process until the fabric is secured. Turning away might not create the same secure hold since the position and tension is less optimal.",
        "Considering that turning the clothes pin towards you creates a more secure hold, Option A provides a better method for effectively pinning down the fabric.",
        "Thus, the correct answer is Option A: Using clothes pins push it through both pieces of fabric away from you and then turn it towards you and then push it back through both pieces of fabric and repeat this until you covered the outside of the fabric."
